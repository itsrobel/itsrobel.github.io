It encompasses a range of cultural, social, and personal attributes that are considered masculine within a given society or cultural context.\nTraditionally, masculinity has been associated with traits such as strength, courage, independence, assertiveness, competitiveness, and emotional resilience. These traits have often been linked to traditional gender roles and expectations, where men are expected to be the primary providers and protectors, displaying stoicism and avoiding vulnerability.\nHowever, it is important to note that masculinity is not a fixed or universally defined concept. Different cultures, societies, and individuals may have different ideas and expectations regarding masculinity. Moreover, the understanding of masculinity has evolved over time, and there is increasing recognition of the diversity and fluidity of masculine identities.\nContemporary discussions around masculinity often emphasize the importance of breaking free from rigid gender norms and allowing individuals the freedom to express themselves authentically. This includes encouraging emotional intelligence, empathy, nurturing qualities, and a willingness to engage in non-traditional activities or roles. It\u0026#39;s worth noting that while masculinity refers to the characteristics associated with men, it is not exclusive to individuals who identify as male. Masculinity and femininity exist on a spectrum, and people of all genders can embody masculine traits and behaviors.\nOverall, the concept of masculinity is complex and can vary significantly across cultures and contexts. It is important to approach it with an understanding of its cultural and historical dimensions and recognize that there is no singular definition of masculinity that applies to all individuals or societies.\n### what is toxic masculinity: Toxic masculinity refers to a set of harmful behaviors, attitudes, and expectations associated with traditional notions of masculinity. It involves rigid and narrow ideas about what it means to be a man, which can be detrimental to both men themselves and those around them.\nToxic masculinity perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and enforces societal pressures that often discourage men from expressing their emotions, seeking help, or deviating from traditional masculine roles. Some common characteristics associated with toxic masculinity include:\nSuppression of emotions: Men are often expected to display stoicism and avoid expressing vulnerability or sensitivity. This can lead to difficulties in managing and understanding their own emotions, as well as creating barriers to forming meaningful connections with others. Aggression and dominance: Toxic masculinity often promotes aggression, dominance, and the need to assert power over others. This can contribute to a hostile and violent environment, both physically and emotionally. Homophobia and misogyny: Toxic masculinity can foster a fear or disdain for anything perceived as feminine, including traits, behaviors, or interests associated with women or non-binary individuals. This can result in the marginalization and mistreatment of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. Pressure to conform to traditional gender roles: Toxic masculinity reinforces rigid gender roles and expectations, pressuring men to be the primary breadwinners, take charge in all situations, and avoid activities or interests considered \u0026#34;feminine.\u0026#34; This can limit individuality and hinder personal growth and fulfillment. It is important to note that toxic masculinity is not inherent to all men or masculinity as a whole. Many men reject toxic masculine norms and embrace healthier expressions of masculinity that promote equality, empathy, emotional well-being, and respectful relationships.\nAddressing toxic masculinity requires challenging and dismantling harmful stereotypes and expectations placed on men. Promoting inclusivity, emotional literacy, and encouraging a broader understanding of masculinity can help create a more equitable and compassionate society for everyone. ### then what should a man be? Defining what a man should be is a subjective and personal question that can vary depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives. It is essential to recognize that there is no singular \u0026#34;correct\u0026#34; way to be a man, as masculinity is diverse and can be expressed in numerous positive and healthy ways. Here are some general aspects that are often associated with positive expressions of masculinity:\nAuthenticity: Embracing authenticity means being true to oneself and expressing one\u0026#39;s thoughts, emotions, and values honestly. It involves rejecting societal expectations that pressure men to conform to narrow stereotypes and allowing for a broader range of experiences and expressions. Emotional intelligence: Cultivating emotional intelligence involves recognizing, understanding, and managing one\u0026#39;s emotions, as well as being empathetic towards others. It includes being open to vulnerability and seeking emotional support when needed. Respectful and inclusive behavior: Treating others with respect, regardless of gender, is a crucial aspect of positive masculinity. This involves promoting gender equality, challenging harmful stereotypes, and actively supporting the rights and well-being of all individuals. Healthy relationships: Building and maintaining healthy relationships involves effective communication, active listening, and fostering mutual trust and support. It includes promoting consent, equality, and respect within personal and professional interactions. Responsibility and accountability: Taking responsibility for one\u0026#39;s actions, being accountable for mistakes, and striving for personal growth are important qualities associated with positive masculinity. This includes recognizing the impact of one\u0026#39;s actions on others and working towards positive change. Rejecting violence and aggression: Promoting non-violence and rejecting aggressive or violent behavior is crucial. Positive masculinity involves resolving conflicts through peaceful means and understanding that strength is not solely measured by physical power. It\u0026#39;s important to remember that these aspects are not exhaustive, and there is no fixed checklist for being a \u0026#34;perfect\u0026#34; man. Every individual has unique qualities, values, and experiences that contribute to their own understanding and expression of masculinity. Embracing diversity, being open-minded, and allowing individuals the freedom to define their own identity is essential in creating a more inclusive and supportive society for all.\n### so would the traits listed above be considered masculine traits?\nYes, the traits listed above are often associated with positive expressions of masculinity.

Traits that were traditionally associated with masculinity or femininity are now understood as existing on a spectrum, and individuals can embody a combination of both or neither.\nRather than labeling these traits as exclusively masculine, it is more accurate to view them as qualities that promote healthy and positive relationships, personal growth, and emotional well-being for all individuals, regardless of gender. By recognizing and valuing these traits in everyone, we contribute to creating a more inclusive and equitable society.\nif those traits arent exclusively masculine then what traits are: Traits that have been traditionally associated with masculinity include:\nStrength and physical prowess: Physical strength and athleticism have often been associated with masculinity, emphasizing qualities such as endurance, power, and agility.\nCourage and resilience: Men have been expected to display bravery and resilience in the face of challenges or adversity, showing a willingness to take risks and overcome obstacles.\nIndependence and self-reliance: Men have historically been expected to be self-sufficient and independent, able to provide for themselves and their families without relying on others for support.\nAssertiveness and leadership: Masculinity has often been linked to assertiveness, confidence, and the ability to take charge in various situations.

Men have often been encouraged to strive for achievements and compete with others to demonstrate their capabilities.\nIt\u0026#39;s important to note that the understanding of masculinity has evolved, and not all individuals or cultures define masculinity in the same way. These traits should not be seen as prescriptive or limiting, and they do not apply to all men universally. Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that individuals can embody a wide range of traits regardless of their gender identity.\nif those are traits of masculinity wouldnt anything that arent that not be considered masculine: No, that\u0026#39;s not necessarily the case.

This means recognizing and valuing a wide range of traits and expressions that may not align with traditional stereotypes.\nThe intention is not to establish new societal expectations but rather to promote acceptance, respect, and equality for individuals of all genders, allowing them to express their authentic selves and embrace a wider spectrum of traits and behaviors without judgment or limitation.\nUltimately, the goal is to create a more diverse and inclusive society where everyone is free to express their unique identities and qualities, regardless of traditional notions of masculinity or femininity.\nif the purpose is to expand definitions of words than the words themselves lose meaning: Expanding the definitions and understanding of words, such as masculinity, does not necessarily result in the loss of meaning. Instead, it allows for a more nuanced and inclusive interpretation that reflects the evolving nature of language and societal perspectives.\nLanguage is a dynamic tool that adapts to changes in society, culture, and individual experiences. As our understanding of concepts evolves, it is natural for language to evolve as well in order to accurately represent the complexity of human experiences.\nExpanding the definition of masculinity does not negate its existing meaning but rather acknowledges that masculinity, like any other social construct, is multifaceted and can be expressed in diverse ways. It allows for a broader recognition of the diverse experiences, expressions, and identities of individuals who identify as male or masculine.\nBy embracing a more inclusive understanding of masculinity, we create space for individuals to define and explore their own identities and expressions without feeling constrained by rigid societal expectations. This fosters a more accepting and supportive environment for everyone.\nIt\u0026#39;s important to approach language with flexibility and open-mindedness, recognizing that meanings can shift and expand as our understanding of complex concepts deepens.

It is a product of cultural, historical, and social factors that influence the expectations, behaviors, and roles associated with masculinity.\nWhile there may be biological differences between sexes, the specific traits and characteristics attributed to masculinity vary across cultures and historical periods. They are not fixed or universal, but rather shaped by social norms, values, and expectations.\nFor example, what is considered masculine in one culture or society may differ from what is considered masculine in another. The specific expectations and ideals associated with masculinity can change over time, reflecting shifts in social and cultural contexts.\nRecognizing masculinity as a social construct allows us to critically examine and challenge the limitations, stereotypes, and harmful aspects that may be associated with traditional or toxic notions of masculinity. It opens up possibilities for more inclusive and diverse understandings of gender and identity, allowing individuals to express themselves authentically and without rigid constraints.\nwhat is a man: A man is an adult human male.

However, it\u0026#39;s important to note that the concept of \u0026#34;man\u0026#34; extends beyond biological attributes and encompasses social, cultural, and personal dimensions.\nIn a social and cultural context, being a man often involves the adoption of masculine gender roles and expectations that are influenced by societal norms and cultural beliefs. These roles and expectations can vary across different societies and historical periods, shaping the behaviors, traits, and responsibilities associated with manhood.\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that the understanding of manhood is not static or universally defined. Gender identity is a complex aspect of human experience, and some individuals may not identify with the traditional concept of manhood or may identify as a man while not aligning with stereotypical expectations.\nIt is important to approach the concept of manhood with sensitivity, acknowledging that individual experiences, expressions, and identities can vary widely.

Engaging in discussions, listening to different voices, and being open to new ideas can help us challenge and move beyond any potential biases or limitations present in the training data.\nUltimately, it is through a collective and ongoing dialogue that we can shape and redefine societal expectations in a way that promotes inclusivity, equality, and a more nuanced understanding of gender identities and expressions.\n","date":"20 December 2023","permalink":"/topics/masculinity/","section":"Topics","summary":"What is masculinity: Masculinity is a complex and multifaceted concept that refers to the qualities, behaviors, and characteristics typically associated with men and masculinity.","title":"Masculinity"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":"What is the role of King? #The hierarchical position has evolved drastically throughout history and across different cultures. Throughout history, the king was seen as a divine or semi-divine figure maintaining supreme authority over their subjects. With the establishment of democracy in the fifth century B.C.E. Athens, the king transformed into a mortal political leader who governed with the support of a powerful noble class or with the consent of a representative body. In many feudal societies, the king was the supreme ruler who held all political power and was responsible for administrating justice, maintaining order, and protecting the kingdom from external threats. Because of the innate parasocial relationship between kings and their subjects, or the more favorable term “constituents,” Kings were often considered divinely ordained or, better yet, designated themselves to be of divine origin. This “Godhood” gave way to absolute power, as no mortal subject would ever dare oppose a God. In more modern societies, the role of the king has changed dramatically. In many countries, the monarchy is now a ceremonial or symbolic institution with limited political power; instead, elected representatives hold the real power. The symbolic nature of royalty stands ever present throughout the United Kingdom. In other countries, however, the monarchy has been abolished altogether.\nIdealistic King #The fine arts and media were birthed and enjoyed by the elites – lords, ladies, kings, and queens. Subjects in the position of bards, storytellers, and arts would make a living by portraying their king in the best light to “making a living” or, more accurately, to continue living. In any case, the progression of civilizations, far-reaching outside the bounds of the obsolete feudal governance, idealizes kings as being that should be noble and just. The relevant case of media idealization would be the Great King Arthur (and the Knights of the Round Table). According to the legend, King Arthur Pendragon was a legendary British king who ruled during the late 5th and early 6th century. He was the son of King Uther Pendragon and was raised by Sir Hector as a ward of the court. As a young man, Arthur pulled the great sword Excalibur from a stone and, with that, claimed his role as the true king of Britain, As King Arthur established a court of Camelot.\nSymbolism #There is a noticeable inclination in modern civilizations to worship those who hold the position of a celebrity. Musicians, actors, and the more recent development of online influencers carry with them the same parasocial relationship as the kings and queens of feudal times. This relationship between celebrities and fans is, in part, in some way exploitive, whether that be for more money, ever an increasing political agenda, or some other social metric; this “exploitation” does happen to drastically vary from celebrity to celebrity as the level of opportunistic capacity varies from person to person, but I digress.\nIn 2018, the film “Black Panther” was released, based on the title character and directed by Ryan Coogler. The film was set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Chadwick Boseman as T\u0026rsquo;Challa/Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, Lupita Nyong\u0026rsquo;o as Nakia, and Danai Gurira as Okoye. The film was a critical and commercial success and received widespread praise for its groundbreaking representation of Black characters and themes.\nIt was also the first superhero film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film inspired thousands to millions of young people of color that they could be their king or queen.I was one of them. When I first left the movie theater at 14, I was utterly filled with hope and some pride because the people in the production “looked just like me”. In this instance, both the actor and character take the role of pseudo-kings; for the minds of youth, having a robust role model is a crucial part of developing into an adult.\nHowever, they are nothing more than public figures. These pseudo-kings hold power in mind and not by will, thus making them symbolic of whatever cause they choose part take in. And depending on the cause, it can also be their downfall as a symbol.\nLooking back, it is strange that I had such a strong reaction to the movie when the character itself was not real, and none of the events happened. There are far better role models than a King living in an isolated society fighting crime in a catsuit sponsored by a magical space rock (Yes, Vibranium is, in fact, magic, it does way too much crazy nonsense not to be, I do not care that they call it a metal). Better role models for young Black Americans would be Malcolm X, MLK, Muhammad Ali, or more contemporary leaders such as Magatte Wade, David Goggins, or Idris Elba (Yes, Idris Elba is an actor, but he is also a film developer in the West African nation of Ghana, so I am making an exception).\nI believe it is essential to clarify that these sorts of pseudo-kings and role models should be recognized as separate entities. Role models are essential in inspiring others in the face of hardship; false kings do nothing more than leach off the people, positioning them at their status level with no real power over the public besides drawing their attention. While I provided examples of famous people as role models, those two traits do not have to coexist simultaneously. A role model can be anyone, but as an idealistic model for behavior, you should avoid meeting them or letting their actions affect you directly. If the actions of a public figure do directly influence you, their role transforms into that of a pseudo-king.\nThe dragon king #The noble king is often found in media but rarely in history, as a dark mirror to the idealism of King Arthur is the realism of Vlad III. Vlad III, also known as Vlad the Impaler, was a medieval ruler of Wallachia, a region in present-day Romania, who lived from 1431 to 1476. Vlad is known for his cruelty and his use of impalement as a method of execution, hence earned him the nickname \u0026ldquo;Vlad the Impaler\u0026rdquo;.\nVlad\u0026rsquo;s father was a member of the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order founded to protect Christianity in Europe. After his father\u0026rsquo;s death, Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia, a position he held three times between 1448 and 1476. During his reign, Vlad was known for his brutal tactics against his enemies, including but not limited to…\n\u0026ldquo;impaling them on stakes and leaving their bodies to rot in public view as warning to others. Boiling, burning, and blinding.“. Some saw Vlad as a hero for his efforts to resist the Ottoman Empire, which was seeking to expand into Eastern Europe. He is mainly known for his campaign against the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, during which he impaled tens of thousands of Ottoman soldiers and prisoners of war. Vlad was eventually captured by his enemies and imprisoned, and he was killed in battle in 1476 while trying to regain his throne.\nVlad Tepe\u0026rsquo;s story is the public perception that “Dracula” has. Vlad III has been mentioned as a part of the violent tyrants of all time for his ruthlessness and cruelty. A large part of Vlad\u0026rsquo;s perception has to do a cycle of propaganda.\nVlad maintained a deep-seated hatred of the Valachian nobles who murdered his father and brother. The moment Vlad regained power, he quickly disposed of the traitorous noblemen. Naturally, the nobles retaliated by spreading false rumors and plotting to depose him. With the aid of a fake letter, they managed to convince the king of Hungary, Matthias I, that Vlad desired to ally himself with the Sultan. As a result, he imprisoned the Wallachian voivode in Visegrád. He was killed fighting the nobles after he regained the throne. “During Vlad’s imprisonment, news of his false betrayal spread through Europe, fueled further by his reputation. He became the subject of several paintings where he is portrayed as either Pilate or as Aegeas, the Roman proconsul of Patras, present at the crucifixion of Saint Andrew. Also, he is the subject of a poem written by Michael Beheims, entitled “Story of a Despot Called Dracula, Voivode of Wallachia.” It should be clear by now that regardless of how cruel he may or may not have been, that was the reputation Vlad III garnished. Vlad III was crucial in resisting The Ottoman Empire march on to West Europe, because of this was responsible for protecting Christianity as we know it now. The same Christianity that would go on to label him as Tepes as Dracula.\nWhen reality bleeds #King Arthur, I would argue, did nothing more than pick up a sword and defend his people from the monstrous invaders. In the same way, Vlad III picked up ten-foot wooden stakes and did the same thing. There are two main differences from Arthur’s and Dracula’s story. The difference is that the monsters that Arthur killed were just that monsters, that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in reality and are only a figment of our shared imagination.\nTo add depth to the character of Dracula, the vast majority of the populace claim that the primary inspiration for the vampire king was the real-life Vladimir Dracul Tepes. This basis, however, has no real merit for a couple of reasons. In Bram Stoker\u0026rsquo;s tale, Dracula follows none of the actions or even acts similarly to Vlad Tepes, other than being \u0026ldquo;bloodthirsty\u0026rdquo; but to claim that Stoker\u0026rsquo;s only reference to a Tepes was taking an abstract adjective and making it hyper-literal.\nWhile Dracula is frequently represented in the film as a direct representation of Bram Stoker\u0026rsquo;s vampiric tyrant, there are a few extraordinary retellings. My favorite is not a \u0026ldquo;Dracula,\u0026rdquo; but one that fits the \u0026ldquo;tyrannical blood lusted king archetype\u0026rdquo;.\nKing Bradley is pivotal in the “Fullmetal Alchemist” and “Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood” anime series. As the leader of the country of Amestris and holder of the title \u0026ldquo;Führer,\u0026rdquo; Bradley is portrayed as a charismatic, powerful, and ruthless leader who enforces the government\u0026rsquo;s laws with an iron fist. However, as the story progresses, his true identity as a homunculus is revealed, adding depth and complexity to his character and motivations. One of the most significant aspects of King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s character is his role as a leader. Throughout the series, he is shown as a charismatic and effective leader who commands respect and loyalty from his subordinates. He is also skilled in combat, possessing incredible speed, agility, and strength. As a result, he is often called upon to carry out dangerous missions and defend his country from external threats. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Bradley\u0026rsquo;s leadership is not as benevolent as it initially appears. He is revealed to be a homunculus created through alchemy with no soul. This revelation adds complexity to his character, as it raises questions about his true loyalties and motivations. It is eventually revealed that Bradley\u0026rsquo;s ultimate goal is to carry out the plans of his creator, Father, to create a massive transmutation circle that will grant him god-like power.\nOne of King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s most notorious actions is his role in the Ishvalan War, a conflict between the state of Amestris and the Ishvalan people. Bradley was directly involved in the war as a commanding officer, and his actions were brutal and ruthless during this time. He led the military\u0026rsquo;s efforts to eliminate the Ishvalans, using alchemical weapons and ordering his soldiers to kill indiscriminately. As a result, many Ishvalans were massacred, and the survivors were forced into ghettos. Bradley\u0026rsquo;s cruelty extended beyond the Ishvalan War, as he was also responsible for numerous assassinations and acts of terror against his people. He ordered the murder of anyone who threatened his power or the stability of the state, including members of his cabinet. He was also directly involved in creating the Homunculi, artificial beings created through alchemy, and used them as tools to carry out his schemes and eliminate his enemies. Despite his ruthless nature and questionable motivations, Bradley is shown to have a human side. He is portrayed as having a deep affection for his wife, whom he refers to as \u0026ldquo;Mrs. Bradley,\u0026rdquo; and his son, Selim. This aspect of his character creates a conflict between his duties as a leader and his relationships, as he is forced to choose between his duty to his country and his family. Overall, King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s reign was marked by violence, oppression, and terror, and he was willing to commit any atrocity to maintain his power and control. His actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability and justice in leadership.\nContext of kings #This section is in no way a defense of the actions of people with the role of the king. Unlike most, royalty is granted a self-autonomy that most of humanity did not have. Life before the 20th century was unapologetically terrible for everyone. Even with significantly lower economic power, the quality of life that the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; Westerner experienced is significantly higher than the kings in history.\nHistory has been a mixed bag for different individuals and groups as progress, triumphs, tragedies, and atrocities have marked it. While some people have enjoyed great wealth, power, and privilege, others have experienced poverty, oppression, and discrimination.\nBecause of the institution of succession, most kings were born into their power. A result of hyperactive nepotism is a lot of unqualified leaders. And even those who would be considered to be qualified still often find themselves in the pitfalls of history. King Charles I was the monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1625 until his execution in 1649. He was born on November 19, 1600, at Dunfermline Palace in Scotland, the second son of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Charles was raised in the Anglican faith and received a royal education. Charles became king in 1625 after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, and he quickly became embroiled in conflict with Parliament over issues such as taxation, foreign policy, and religious freedom. In 1642, tensions between Charles and Parliament erupted into the English Civil War, with Charles leading the Royalist forces against the Parliamentarian forces led by Oliver Cromwell. The war was long and brutal, with both sides committing atrocities and inflicting significant damage on the country. In 1646, Charles surrendered to the Scottish army, but the Scottish turned him over to Parliament in exchange for payment of their expenses. In 1648, Charles tried to regain his throne by force, but the Parliamentarians defeated and captured him. In January 1649, he was put on trial for high treason, found guilty, and sentenced to death. On January 30, 1649, Charles was beheaded at the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London. Charles\u0026rsquo; execution was a watershed moment in English history, leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, which lasted until the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Charles was later canonized by the Church of England as a martyr and is commemorated in the Church\u0026rsquo;s calendar on January 30.\nThe Royal UK writes this about Charles…\n“ Charles was reserved (he had a residual stammer), self-righteous and had a high concept of royal authority, believing in the divine right of kings. He was a good linguist and a sensitive man of refined es. He spent a lot on the arts, inviting the artists Van Dyck and Rubens to work in England, and buying a great collection of paintings by Raphael and Titian (this collection was later dispersed under Cromwell). Charles I also instituted the post of Master of the King\u0026rsquo;s Music, involving supervision of the King\u0026rsquo;s large band of musicians; the post survives today.”\nCharles is a character I do not believe to be an outlier in the history of kings. In fact, I believe his rise and fall are far more representative of the history of kings than figures like King Cyrus or Alexander. That is to say, being placed on a high pedestal in society creates a level of exposure for one individual that a person is not naturally equipped to handle. Charles, the first, only cared about the purpose and his own interest, and because of the level of power that a king has, he could do what he wanted without any resistance. He failed to calculate the effects of his actions or how the public would view him, and due to that failure lost his life\nBe wary of those who aspire to be \u0026ldquo;king.\u0026rdquo; #A cautionary note about those who seek positions of power and authority. While not all individuals who aspire to leadership roles are inherently bad or corrupt, history has shown that many leaders have abused their power and committed atrocities in the pursuit of their own interests. Leaders who seek power for its own sake may be more interested in maintaining their own position and authority than in serving the interests of their constituents. They are willing to compromise their values, to lie, to cheat, or commit acts of violence to protect their position or to further their own agenda. Therefore, it is important to be vigilant and discerning when evaluating those who seek leadership roles. It is important to consider their values, track record, and intentions, as well as their ability to work collaboratively and listen to diverse perspectives. Make no mistake my western readers, we have kings in our world, and the most powerful ones are the ones that you do not know exist.\n","date":"26 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/kings/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is the role of King?","title":"Kings"},{"content":"What is the role of King? #The hierarchical position has evolved drastically throughout history and across different cultures.

Charles I also instituted the post of Master of the King\u0026rsquo;s Music, involving supervision of the King\u0026rsquo;s large band of musicians; the post survives today.”\nCharles is a character I do not believe to be an outlier in the history of kings. In fact, I believe his rise and fall are far more representative of the history of kings than figures like King Cyrus or Alexander. That is to say, being placed on a high pedestal in society creates a level of exposure for one individual that a person is not naturally equipped to handle. Charles, the first, only cared about the purpose and his own interest, and because of the level of power that a king has, he could do what he wanted without any resistance. He failed to calculate the effects of his actions or how the public would view him, and due to that failure lost his life\nBe wary of those who aspire to be \u0026ldquo;king.\u0026rdquo; #A cautionary note about those who seek positions of power and authority. While not all individuals who aspire to leadership roles are inherently bad or corrupt, history has shown that many leaders have abused their power and committed atrocities in the pursuit of their own interests. Leaders who seek power for its own sake may be more interested in maintaining their own position and authority than in serving the interests of their constituents. They are willing to compromise their values, to lie, to cheat, or commit acts of violence to protect their position or to further their own agenda. Therefore, it is important to be vigilant and discerning when evaluating those who seek leadership roles. It is important to consider their values, track record, and intentions, as well as their ability to work collaboratively and listen to diverse perspectives. Make no mistake my western readers, we have kings in our world, and the most powerful ones are the ones that you do not know exist.\n","date":"26 February 2023","permalink":"/topics/kings/","section":"Topics","summary":"What is the role of King?","title":"Kings"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/philosophy/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"philosophy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":"Introduction #For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine and their counterparts, whether they be demons, djins, or any other spiritual manifestation of power. While admittedly, they are a figment of my obsession with power, angels also serve as a foundation for the universe in a cosmological sense to maintain balance.\nThe Servants of Allah #In Islam, angels are considered part of the unseen world and are believed to play a significant role in the daily life of a Muslim.\nMuslims believe that angels were created by Allah (God) and are made of light. They are not physical beings and cannot be seen by humans, but their presence can be felt.\nAngels have several vital roles in Islam, including:\nMessengers: from Allah and are said to convey Allah\u0026rsquo;s messages to humans.\nRecorders: of a person\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, words, and actions.\nProtectors: of human beings, with each person having two angels who record their actions.\nGuardians: of heaven and hell and to be responsible for guarding the gates of each.\nIntermediaries: between Allah and humans, carrying out his commands and responding to human needs and prayers.\nIslam recognizes several specific angels, including Gabriel (Jibreel), Michael (Mika\u0026rsquo;il), and Azrael (Izra\u0026rsquo;il), who are mentioned in the Qur\u0026rsquo;an. Each angel is believed to have a unique role and responsibility in serving Allah and the world.\nIn Islam, angels play a significant role in the daily life of a Muslim and are seen as constant reminders of the presence and power of Allah in the world. Muslims are encouraged to seek their protection and strive for their good deeds and actions to receive their blessings and guidance.\nIt is imperative to note that within the religion of Islam, there are no\u0026hellip;\nFallen Angels #Appear in many religious traditions to describe a celestial being who has been cast out of heaven or rebelled against God or the divine realm. The concept of fallen angels is most commonly associated with Christianity and Judaism, but it is also present in other religious traditions, such as Zoroastrianism. It is important to note that there does not exist any fallen angels in Islam.\n- #Disobedience to God #Spirits In the Sands #Contrary to what I just said, a few examples of falling from grace in Islamic Tradition serve as extreme outliers. The Jedo-Christan satanic equivalent in Islam is known as Iblis.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Iblis was a jinn created by Allah and was one of the most elevated and respected Jinn. However, when Allah commanded all of his creations to bow down to Adam, Iblis refused, stating that he was made of fire and was, therefore, superior to Adam, who was made of clay.\nAs a result of his rebellion and arrogance, Allah cast Iblis out of heaven and into hell, where he became the embodiment of evil and the leader of the forces of darkness. Iblis is often depicted as the tempter of humans, trying to lead them astray from the path of righteousness and into sin and temptation.\nIn Islamic belief, Iblis represents the ultimate evil and the embodiment of pride and arrogance and is seen as the embodiment of everything that is opposed to the will of Allah. Due to Iblis\u0026rsquo;s nature as a Jinn, he is not an angelic fallen.\nThe Morning Star #In Christian and Jewish traditions, the fall of the angels is typically associated with the story of Lucifer, a high-ranking angel who rebelled against God and was cast out of heaven as a result. According to tradition, Lucifer and the angels who followed him became demons and are now seen as agents of evil and corruption in the world. Or at least that is the popular interpretation of Lucifer. The name Lucifer only appears once throughout the Bible in the Old Testament.\nIsaiah 14:12-15 KJV\n12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. over the years many believers have taken this count of Lucifer and equated him to Satan the king of Hell and demons. However the subject of this passage is NOT Satan but instead a Babylon king\u0026hellip;\nIsaiah 14:4-5\n4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 5 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. This misconception about Lucifer is rather frustrating as it is a core aspect of the Christine doctrine. From what I can tell, the rise in popularity of seeing Lucifer as the Devil was more or less a political move from the Church to garnish more power. If promising eternal life would not convert the masses using fear would. And that fear could inviability be used for control.\nThe Poison of God #Samael is a name that is associated with various religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism. My favorite interpretation of Samael is within the Talmudic and post-Talmudic literature. Samael holds the title of the left hand of God and his name directly translates to the venom of God. In Jewish tradition, Samael is sometimes portrayed as an angel or demon who is associated with death and destruction. In some texts, Samael is depicted as the accuser of God\u0026rsquo;s people and as the leader of the evil spirits a synonym for Satan.\nMost importantly, however, Samael is directly responsible for the fall of Adam as Samael was the one who seduced Eve in the garden of Eden. From his Affiar with Eve, a child was born. Humanities first murderer and the man cursed to eternally walk barren lands, Cain.\nIn many tellings of creation, Samael is said to be the lover of Lilith, Adam\u0026rsquo;s first wife, with their union being the dark mirror of Adam and Eve. From their union, they birth the demons, demons that would then be used by Lilith in a revolt against God. As a result, God castrated Samael and was said to banish him from Heaven and sentence the fallen angel to serve as the guardian of Esau.\nThe last notable encounter with the Dark angel appears in the\u0026hellip;\nAscension of Moses #\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, \u0026ldquo;Anger,\u0026rdquo; and Hemah, \u0026ldquo;Wrath,\u0026rdquo; whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, \u0026ldquo;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,\u0026rdquo; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. \u0026ldquo;This one,\u0026rdquo; said Metatron, addressing Moses, \u0026ldquo;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Whither goes he now?\u0026rdquo; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, \u0026ldquo;To fetch the soul of Job the pious.\u0026rdquo; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, \u0026ldquo;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n- #The Two other faiths where Samael makes an appearance are Gnosticism and Kabbalah. In Gnosticism, Samael is often portrayed as a powerful and malevolent deity who is opposed to the true God and is responsible for the creation of the material world. Some Gnostic sects saw Samael as the demiurge, the architect of the physical universe who was responsible for the suffering and imperfections of the world. Throughout the Kabbalah, Samael is seen as one of the Sephirot, the ten attributes of God. In this tradition, Samael is associated with the sefirah of Gevurah, which represents strength, power, and judgment.\nWith so many writings and stories about Samael, no one truly knows the entirety of his existence. The only thing certain is that if at all possible, it is wise for any mortal to avoid the poison of God.\nThe Watchers #The \u0026ldquo;Watchers\u0026rdquo; are a group of angels mentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish text that is not considered part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible but is still considered significant by some religious groups, such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\nAccording to the Book of Enoch, the Watchers were a group of 200 angels who were sent to earth to watch over the human race. However, the Watchers became enamored with the beauty of human women, took wives for themselves, and began teaching humans about various heaven secrets, including astrology and magic. This teaching was seen as corrupting humanity and leading them astray from God.\nAs a result of their rebellion, the Watchers were punished by God and cast into a deep prison, where they were to remain until the end of time. The offspring of the Watchers and their human wives were the Nephilim, who were seen as powerful and evil beings.\nThe Book of Enoch is considered by some to be a pseudepigraphical text, meaning that it is attributed to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah, but was likely written much later and by an anonymous author. The text\u0026rsquo;s exact historical origins and significance are still the subject of debate among scholars.\n- #In these traditions, fallen angels are seen as having once been good and obedient servants of God but who have now become corrupted and are in opposition to God and His purposes.\nThe concept of fallen angels is an important part of many religious traditions and is closely tied to the beliefs about the nature of good and evil, the balance of power between the divine realm and the mortal world, and the idea of divine justice and retribution.\nSeparation of Divine #In Hinduism, devas are celestial beings or gods that are responsible for various natural phenomena and are worshiped as such. They are often portrayed as having supernatural powers and are seen as divine beings of light and goodness. Devas play a significant role in Hindu mythology and are often depicted as having an ongoing struggle with the asuras, which are considered forces of evil.\nIn Buddhism, devas are also seen as divine beings that inhabit higher realms and possess supernatural abilities. However, unlike Hinduism, Buddhism does not worship them as gods but rather sees them as beings that have achieved a higher level of spiritual enlightenment. According to Buddhist teachings, devas have the ability to assist and guide human beings toward enlightenment, but they are still considered to be bound by the cycle of birth and death, just like all other beings. Ultimately, the goal of a Buddhist is to achieve enlightenment and become a deva. Overall, the concept of celestial beings in Buddhism and Hinduism is different from that in Western religions, as the focus in those beliefs is on individual spiritual development and the attainment of enlightenment rather than a belief in a hierarchy of divine beings.\nBecause of the overall cosmological structure of Hinduism, Buddhism, and other closely related eastern faiths, their celestials do not appear to have any \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo; ones. Those who would be classified as evil are almost preordained as such.\nThe Will of Man #The reasons for why God created humanity vary depending on the religious tradition and belief system.\nIn many monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, God is viewed as the creator of the universe and all things within it. The creation of humanity is often seen as the crowning achievement of God\u0026rsquo;s creation, and the reason for humanity\u0026rsquo;s existence is typically framed as an expression of God\u0026rsquo;s love and wisdom.\nFor example, in Christianity, God is seen as having created humanity in His own image, with the intention of having a close relationship with them and bringing them into His kingdom. According to the Bible, God created humanity for the purpose of fellowship and to enjoy a relationship with Him. In Islam, Allah created humanity as His vicegerents on earth and charged them with the responsibility of upholding justice, balance, and order in the world. It is believed that the ultimate goal of humanity\u0026rsquo;s existence is to worship Allah and attain salvation in the hereafter.\nAside from the monotheism doctrines, in Hinduism, the creation of humanity is seen as part of the cycle of creation and destruction, with humans serving as the means by which the divine can experience and understand the world.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s greatest gift, in many instances, is that of free will, free will to create, free will to love, but more evidently, free will to destroy. In the celestial realm of Angels, God\u0026rsquo;s existence is guaranteed; it is present and known.\nReflect on the countless interpretations of the concept of God that have emerged throughout history. Consider the numerous individuals who, convinced of their beliefs, have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of what they perceived to be just. Ponder the countless innocent lives that were cut short due to the actions of these crusaders.\nBut Angels, angels don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer, do they? They already live in heaven; what more could anyone want? I used to be able to ease my mind by using the rationality that Angels are Slaves, and in Islam, they are. However, Being inclined to be Jedo-Christian, my mind is constantly stuck on the thought of hating my mortality.\nIf Angels have free will to sin, falter, and fall while being creations of unspeakable power and the ability to fight demons. How is humanity Gifted? Instead, humanity is cursed with the existence of the celestials. The Nephilim, unholy spawn of the Watchers, ravished the sons of man until the flood. Samael Orchestrated the fall of Adam and then fathered the first great sinner and the demon race. Even if you do not subscribe to Samael\u0026rsquo;s existence, he still exists conceptionally in the morning star.\nDespite the existence of suffering and uncertainty that humanity is faced with, it is all part of a larger divine plan. However, the phrase \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s plan\u0026rdquo; is often used to justify unjust suffering, which is not acceptable. When I refer to \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s plan,\u0026rdquo; I acknowledge that everything we encounter in life is small in comparison to the greater cosmic picture. I hold the belief that there is a righteous way to live and that each individual has their own understanding of what that means. I do not believe I will ever have all my questions answered to the extent that I desire. That uncertainty about life is what makes it worth living.\nThe only certainty is that humanity possesses free will. Live in uncertainty, connect with those around you, and embrace their unique perspectives. We live mortal lives; each decision we make from sunrise to sunset is how we will be remembered when we pass on. I argue you live each moment as if it were your last. Do not let differences in beliefs or ideologies prevent you from seeing the humanity in others.\nAs humans, we are free to suffer in our own ways, and because of that, relief is all the more joyous. In a way, we are more blessed than the celestials. Man is born with a clean slate; ultimately, free will does not mean being free of consequence. Stay true to yourself and your convictions, and may an angel of God guide you to your paradise.\n","date":"1 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/angels/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine and their counterparts, whether they be demons, djins, or any other spiritual manifestation of power.","title":"Angels"},{"content":"Introduction #For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine and their counterparts, whether they be demons, djins, or any other spiritual manifestation of power.

In a way, we are more blessed than the celestials. Man is born with a clean slate; ultimately, free will does not mean being free of consequence. Stay true to yourself and your convictions, and may an angel of God guide you to your paradise.\n","date":"1 February 2023","permalink":"/topics/angels/","section":"Topics","summary":"Introduction #For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine and their counterparts, whether they be demons, djins, or any other spiritual manifestation of power.","title":"Angels"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/religion/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"religion"},{"content":"History #The issue of abortion has been a contentious and divisive one in American politics throughout history. The debate in the United States can be traced back to the 19th century, with the first laws regulating abortion being passed in the 1820s and 1830s. These early laws aimed primarily at protecting women\u0026rsquo;s health and restricting access to abortion only in cases where the procedure was deemed dangerous.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the abortion debate became more politicized as various religious and medical groups took positions. The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed abortion, while the National Organization for Women (NOW) and other feminist groups supported the right to access safe and legal abortibg.jpgn the 1960s and 1970s, the Supreme Court handed down several critical decisions on abortion, including the landmark case of Roe v. Wade in 1973. In this case, the court declared that a woman has a constitutional right to privacy, including the right to terminate her pregnancy. This decision effectively legalized abortion throughout the United States.\nIn the decades that followed, the abortion debate continued to be a contentious issue in American politics. Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life Committee, emerged and worked to restrict access to abortion through legislation at the state and federal levels. Pro-choice groups, such as NARAL Pro-Choice America, also formed and worked to uphold and expand access to abortion.\nThe debate has become increasingly polarized in recent years, with many states passing restrictive abortion laws and the Supreme Court hearing cases overturning Roe v. Wade. The issue continues to be contentious in American politics, with the position on it often a key dividing line between political parties and candidates.\nDebate #Pro-choice #Arguments include the belief that a woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her pregnancy, the idea that banning abortion does not necessarily prevent it from happening but instead makes it more dangerous, and the belief that the government should not be involved in personal medical decisions. Other arguments include that access to safe and legal abortion is necessary for women\u0026rsquo;s equality and economic stability and that having a child can have a severe negative impact on a woman\u0026rsquo;s life, including physical, emotional, and financial burden.\nOther arguments for the Pro-choice include but are not limited to\nAccess to safe and legal abortion is a fundamental right and necessary for women\u0026rsquo;s autonomy and self-determination. Criminalizing abortion does not reduce the number of abortions but instead makes them more dangerous and increases the risk of injury or death for women forced to seek unsafe and illegal procedures. The individuals involved should make decisions about pregnancy and childbirth and not be imposed by the government. The right to access abortion is a form of freedom and privacy. Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term can lead to severe physical, emotional, and mental health consequences for the woman. Access to safe and legal abortion is necessary to ensure that women have the opportunity to participate in society and achieve their full potential fully. Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term can also be detrimental to the child, as they may be born into a family that is not emotionally or financially prepared to care for them. Pro-choice allows for better maternal care, allowing women to control their fertility and decide when to become mothers, ultimately leading to healthier pregnancies, births, and families. One additional argument for Pro-Choice\u0026hellip;\nCrime #There is ongoing debate and research on the relationship between abortion and crime rates. One theory, known as the \u0026ldquo;abortion-crime hypothesis,\u0026rdquo; posits that legalized abortion has led to a reduction in crime because it has prevented the birth of individuals who would have been at a higher risk of committing crimes. This theory was first proposed by economist Steven Levitt in a 2001 paper, which argued that the legalization of abortion in the 1970s led to a decrease in crime in the 1990s by reducing the number of \u0026ldquo;at-risk\u0026rdquo; individuals who would have been more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\nA number of studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis, with mixed results. Some studies have found evidence to support the theory, while others have found no significant relationship between abortion and crime rates. A number of factors have been suggested to explain these inconsistent findings, including variations in research methods and data sources, as well as the complex and multivariate nature of the relationship between abortion and crime.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that, the research on this topic is ongoing and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Some researchers and scholars have argued that there is a correlation between abortion and crime rate but it\u0026rsquo;s important to consider other factors such as economic conditions, public policies, and cultural values that also influence crime rates.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to note that the abortion-crime hypothesis is a controversial theory and its supporters and critics have different opinions on the relationship between abortion and crime rates.\nPro-Life #arguments generally center around the belief that human life begins at conception and that the fetus has the same right to life as a born person. Some key pro-life arguments include:\nAbortion is morally and ethically wrong because it involves taking innocent human life. The fetus is a separate human from the mother, with its unique DNA and potential for life outside the womb. Prohibiting abortion protects the rights of the unborn child, who cannot speak or defend themselves. Abortion can have harmful physical and psychological effects on the mother. Alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, provide viable options for women facing unplanned pregnancies. Many pro-life advocates believe life is a gift from god and should be protected at all costs. Some argue that the legalization of abortion leads to societal moral decay and devaluation of human life in general. Pro-life advocates often seek to protect the rights of the most vulnerable and defenseless members of society, which they see as the unborn child. Like the Pro-Choice arguments, It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that these are general arguments, and not everyone that identifies as pro-life will agree with all of them.\nResolve #To clarify my position, I am in favor of the legal right to access abortion, but I do not believe that this is morally or ethically justifiable. The political Left, specifically the Democratic Party and the Pro-Choice movement, often argue that their stance is morally superior and promotes equality. While this has led to progress in ending injustice in the past, I do not believe that the Left holds the moral high ground in this specific debate.\nOn the other hand, for the Right, specifically the Republican Party and the Pro-Life movement, the belief that they hold a moral high ground does not automatically make their arguments valid. Many members of the Pro-Life movement argue that their position is based on religious beliefs and that God grants them the moral high ground. However, this belief in God or a higher power as a justification for actions is not a new concept, as it is present in the United States Declaration of Independence, which states that all men are created equal and that their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are granted by a creator.\nMany progressive movements in America have used the principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence to push for greater equality. However, it is essential to note that there is a separation of church and state in the United States. This means that while the Declaration of Independence references God and moral principles, these beliefs cannot be used as a basis for creating new laws. Therefore, the Pro-Life movement, often fueled by religious beliefs, should not be used as a justification for laws restricting people\u0026rsquo;s rights. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that an unborn child is not considered a citizen of the United States, so laws meant to protect them may not be legally sound.\nI believe abortion is morally wrong, but I recognize that the societal pressure towards hypersexuality and the resulting unintended pregnancies present a complex issue. With a high number of children already in foster care and adoption centers, the question arises as to whether it is morally justifiable to bring more children into a society where they may be at risk of living in poverty.\n","date":"26 January 2023","permalink":"/posts/deletion/","section":"Posts","summary":"History #The issue of abortion has been a contentious and divisive one in American politics throughout history.","title":"Deletion"},{"content":"History #The issue of abortion has been a contentious and divisive one in American politics throughout history.

Because the curse was ordained by God, then the existence of slavery is just. Because God is ultimately just. God was never said to have removed the curse of Canaan. Therefore with this justification, slavery was not only moral but also eternal. This establishment of slavery, even if it was unfair, God had made so. A fun contradiction to this is in Ezekiel 18:20 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nAll a measure of justification #when men discover something they do not understand; fear is natural.

However, roughly four days ago, I realized this is my website, and I can say whatever I feel like without censorship. Although, I do have to keep in mind that because this is public, I will try to stay professionally subjective.\nWith that being said, here is a nice list of things that make me irrationally angry. However, most items on this list have merit to be upset about. By \u0026ldquo;irrational,\u0026rdquo; I simply mean that I lose composure when some of these topics are brought up. This list is in no particular order.\nlooking toward the stars #I love space. In fact, I like space more than a lot of other people. I was raised watching and reading sci-fiction works that often have space as the setting. Despite that, I can discern fiction from reality. Astrologists, however, cannot accomplish such a feat. Astrology is entirely based on an incredibly illogical system that needs to be updated. Despite this, that does not stop them from continuing to append their belief system, adding value to something where value does not exist. Cosmic balls of gas do not determine anything about someone\u0026rsquo;s personality. The only use of Astrology I have seen is as a justification for the believer\u0026rsquo;s degenerate behaviour. No, just because you are a Leo or something does not predispose you to cheat on your partner.\nThis unironic use of astrology to predetermine how you should treat someone or what someone\u0026rsquo;s personality is is the equivalent of star racism. It\u0026rsquo;s dumb and pointless. The worst part is that it\u0026rsquo;s often used as a submission for proper Religion. Which Segways nicely to my next grievance\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not like those people.\u0026rdquo; #Spirituality is quite frankly ridiculous. And people who say they are \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; are either not using part of their brain or just going along with a trend. The entire purpose of religion is to provide meaning in life and give a set of laws that people should follow to be decent humans. Religion is a practiced and perfected social construction that creates a community in which people reside. When humanity rejects religion, it follows into immorality and nihilism. To escape meaninglessness, spirituality was created. While spirituality does not have a set rule or definitions, that is its problem; it\u0026rsquo;s completely arbitrary to whatever the user wants it to be. Spirituality allows the user to assign meaning to random nonsense and subject the rest of the world to listening to the crap.\nThis one is petty, but\u0026hellip; #Seahorses. Now I am aware that plenty of people like them and think that they are cute. However, that does not stop me from loathing their existence. From an evolutionary standpoint, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue how they are still alive. They have nothing besides mid-tier cammo. They don\u0026rsquo;t have mobility. They don\u0026rsquo;t have any offence; they don\u0026rsquo;t have any defence. If literally, any pretor was chasing them all; a seahorse could do its grab onto like a reef or rock and chill there. A shark could go and get its law degree and come back, and the seahorse would still be there. My hatred for seahorses is purely on the basis that they do not have any right to exist still while much cooler and more versatile animals have become extinct.\nThe most justifiable one #college discussion posts. Believe it or not, in an 8-week class, especially an online one, I truly do not care about what classmates I have; I am there to learn the material and get on with my normal life. For reasons I do not understand, this is a very hard concept for universities to understand because they insist on making me create and reply to things I could not care less about. On top of that, being an engineering major, these discussions couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be more contrived if they tried. I wrote hello world in python, and now you want to comment on how someone else wrote it?\nBack to normal life #I cannot stand when people put unnecessary texture in places where they have no right being. The most prominent example of this in my head would be coconut flakes in between chocolate cake. Imagine you just took a bite of a smooth, rich sweet chocolate cake and in the middle of chewing, some stupid flakes get in between your teeth and stick to the top of your mouth. The entire consistency of the cake is ruined by the presence of coconut, and because of its coconut, it leaves an awful aftertaste. If I wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear before, I detest coconut and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to retire an entire entry for it. However, I will write an entry for\nsoup #Besides onion soup, all other soups suffer from being baby food. Soup is regular food in the water. I am a grown person; I can eat regular food, and anyone past the age of four can eat normal food. And it\u0026rsquo;s not even just the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s for babies; soup tastes worse. Take beef stew, for example. It\u0026rsquo;s a horrid construction, it\u0026rsquo;s dry and lazy, and I eventually eat whatever stew meat is left on a sandwich. Beef stew is just a bad way to prep the food, and I hate it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not that bad\u0026hellip; #People in my life seem to think I am Either completely harmless or borderline evil and should be avoided at all costs. For some reason, this does not have any middle ground in the slightest, and I have found it to be quite annoying. I am still, in fact, a normal person.

However, roughly four days ago, I realized this is my website, and I can say whatever I feel like without censorship. Although, I do have to keep in mind that because this is public, I will try to stay professionally subjective.\nWith that being said, here is a nice list of things that make me irrationally angry. However, most items on this list have merit to be upset about. By \u0026ldquo;irrational,\u0026rdquo; I simply mean that I lose composure when some of these topics are brought up. This list is in no particular order.\nlooking toward the stars #I love space. In fact, I like space more than a lot of other people. I was raised watching and reading sci-fiction works that often have space as the setting. Despite that, I can discern fiction from reality. Astrologists, however, cannot accomplish such a feat. Astrology is entirely based on an incredibly illogical system that needs to be updated. Despite this, that does not stop them from continuing to append their belief system, adding value to something where value does not exist. Cosmic balls of gas do not determine anything about someone\u0026rsquo;s personality. The only use of Astrology I have seen is as a justification for the believer\u0026rsquo;s degenerate behaviour. No, just because you are a Leo or something does not predispose you to cheat on your partner.\nThis unironic use of astrology to predetermine how you should treat someone or what someone\u0026rsquo;s personality is is the equivalent of star racism. It\u0026rsquo;s dumb and pointless. The worst part is that it\u0026rsquo;s often used as a submission for proper Religion. Which Segways nicely to my next grievance\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not like those people.\u0026rdquo; #Spirituality is quite frankly ridiculous. And people who say they are \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; are either not using part of their brain or just going along with a trend. The entire purpose of religion is to provide meaning in life and give a set of laws that people should follow to be decent humans. Religion is a practiced and perfected social construction that creates a community in which people reside. When humanity rejects religion, it follows into immorality and nihilism. To escape meaninglessness, spirituality was created. While spirituality does not have a set rule or definitions, that is its problem; it\u0026rsquo;s completely arbitrary to whatever the user wants it to be. Spirituality allows the user to assign meaning to random nonsense and subject the rest of the world to listening to the crap.\nThis one is petty, but\u0026hellip; #Seahorses. Now I am aware that plenty of people like them and think that they are cute. However, that does not stop me from loathing their existence. From an evolutionary standpoint, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue how they are still alive. They have nothing besides mid-tier cammo. They don\u0026rsquo;t have mobility. They don\u0026rsquo;t have any offence; they don\u0026rsquo;t have any defence. If literally, any pretor was chasing them all; a seahorse could do its grab onto like a reef or rock and chill there. A shark could go and get its law degree and come back, and the seahorse would still be there. My hatred for seahorses is purely on the basis that they do not have any right to exist still while much cooler and more versatile animals have become extinct.\nThe most justifiable one #college discussion posts. Believe it or not, in an 8-week class, especially an online one, I truly do not care about what classmates I have; I am there to learn the material and get on with my normal life. For reasons I do not understand, this is a very hard concept for universities to understand because they insist on making me create and reply to things I could not care less about. On top of that, being an engineering major, these discussions couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly be more contrived if they tried. I wrote hello world in python, and now you want to comment on how someone else wrote it?\nBack to normal life #I cannot stand when people put unnecessary texture in places where they have no right being. The most prominent example of this in my head would be coconut flakes in between chocolate cake. Imagine you just took a bite of a smooth, rich sweet chocolate cake and in the middle of chewing, some stupid flakes get in between your teeth and stick to the top of your mouth. The entire consistency of the cake is ruined by the presence of coconut, and because of its coconut, it leaves an awful aftertaste. If I wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear before, I detest coconut and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to retire an entire entry for it. However, I will write an entry for\nsoup #Besides onion soup, all other soups suffer from being baby food. Soup is regular food in the water. I am a grown person; I can eat regular food, and anyone past the age of four can eat normal food. And it\u0026rsquo;s not even just the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s for babies; soup tastes worse. Take beef stew, for example. It\u0026rsquo;s a horrid construction, it\u0026rsquo;s dry and lazy, and I eventually eat whatever stew meat is left on a sandwich. Beef stew is just a bad way to prep the food, and I hate it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not that bad\u0026hellip; #People in my life seem to think I am Either completely harmless or borderline evil and should be avoided at all costs. For some reason, this does not have any middle ground in the slightest, and I have found it to be quite annoying. I am still, in fact, a normal person. I don\u0026rsquo;t heavily swing to one side on any ideological position that is not supported without complete rationality. Why would I swing so far in terms of personality?\nlater on #I will probably end up updating this list the more that I live on this planet and remember to add things or discover new things that I wish God would remove from existence.\nUpdate Friday, June 16/2023 #Hello, its “later” and i have some more pet peeves.\nYou can’t watch and ignore me #the Audacity that some of these kids have now days is wild to me.

I never ended up applying to any university with it, but I do think it does an ok job at representing me and my personality.\nVoid #Each step is no more complicated than the last, a simple motion, a progression in thought. Walking is always different and never distinct. When walking, the world becomes a void and nothing more than a background to the universes in your head. In my universe, there is a shining star.\nOutside of religion and higher powers, the justifications for natural laws and moral rights feel like 4th-dimensional mental gymnastics. One of the more debated philosophical concepts is the simple question, “what is the meaning of life?” Religion’s more innate and extraordinary power is that it provides meaning to life, but without it, one finds ideologies that vary in quality. If you were to ask some hitchhiker this question, you might get something as random as the number 42. 3rd-century philosopher saint Augustine believed that God is good and the word of God is good; anything outside of God and his teachings is the source of evil. A life without God creates a void, and that void, I believe, is often misrepresented. The philosophical emptiness of nihilism.\nUrban dictionary defines nihilistic as “A word that nobody really knows what it actually means but is often used by [pretentious]book and film [critics]so that they can feel [smug].” While this is not an actual definition, it alludes to the mysticism surrounding the term. Nihilism is paradoxical in meaning. Nihilism paints the world with a colourless black brush—an empty yet endless void of meaning. A belief in nothing is still a belief in something. Nihilism is a physiological response to suffering. Suffering is only worsened by the idea that resisting is futile and pointless. In accordance with the development of nihilism, my path began as a response to the things I could not control. “blood is thicker than water.” My elders always told me. A belief that family, that blood was the essential thing in life, that meaning was derived from such. By the time I was born, there was already a void in my blood.\nMy blood in fatherhood had long since run stale to the ruin of time. Soon after, the blood in my grandmother breathed its last breath. My blood in maternity was quick to be forgotten. My Ethiopian heritage became nothing more than a box to check on forms and applications. A checkbox that meant nothing since I had already lost all semblance of culture. The prospect that blood was of the highest importance was a void I could not fill.\nUnder nihilism, there can be a certain level of optimism in rejecting that anything has innate value; you can set those values. I put my values into reaching the stars, constantly reaching for new knowledge and higher understanding with each breath. This value system, while beneficial educationally, still failed to fill the void. I grew up in a universe that never felt like my own, an alien lost in the stars. In my search for meaning, I found other “aliens,” people who differ in beliefs, ideologies, and blood. I found a universe of scholars, creators, and dreamers. I was able to fill my void with a community. A community that taught me a lesson my elders had inaccurately informed me. “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” The bonds we choose to make with those around us are more valuable than the ones we are born with.\nEach religion and word of God throughout history are retellings of the value of community to educate individuals on how to live righteously. Eventually, I had to leave my universe of aliens so we could return to our homes. I remain still an alien, but with the hope that through education, I can one day create a universe of my own so that other aliens do not have to walk alone and gaze into an endless void and instead see their stars.\n","date":"2 January 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Intro Intro #I am incredibly lazy, and instead of writing original content for my about page, I will simply copy-paste my common application.","title":""},{"content":"Intro #This essay was written for the MLK mentored program at the University of Louisville. I still believe in the topic and find it relevant. Doing research for this paper has opened my eyes to the ingrained tyranny the black community has faced, even from a religious standpoint. I have made some editorial changes for the essay to be more suitable for the blog but the main points and the majority of the text is largely untouched.\nFundamentally #no one person is born racist. Racism is a behavioral pattern that is taught through culture. Racism is the product of social conditioning. Within western society, when the European nations expanded and came across Asian and African cultures, they did not understand what they found. Those Europeans found a group of people who were different. People who had different beliefs. Different Traditions.Different Values. And within those Differences, fear was born. The Europeans turned towards their God, bible, and faith as justification for slavery.\nThe curse of Ham, Ham gazed upon Noah, drunken and nude; while Ham\u0026rsquo;s two brothers ran to cover Noah, Ham did not. because of Ham\u0026rsquo;s insolence, Noah cursed Ham and his sons, the sons of Canaan. The sons of Cain.\nThe descendants of Cain were believed to be Africans, declared in the bible as \u0026ldquo;the servants of servants.\u0026rdquo;. Because the curse was ordained by God, then the existence of slavery is just. Because God is ultimately just. God was never said to have removed the curse of Canaan. Therefore with this justification, slavery was not only moral but also eternal. This establishment of slavery, even if it was unfair, God had made so. A fun contradiction to this is in Ezekiel 18:20 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nAll a measure of justification #when men discover something they do not understand; fear is natural. To understand men capture, control, and enslave. The point of the story is best explained through the words of Winston Churchill, \u0026ldquo;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u0026rdquo; Always cloth naked people you see. Jokes aside, the real point of conflict here is the product of a lack of understanding. When Europeans discovered the Africans and the Asians, they placed themselves in a position of superiority. A lack of knowledge that the people they had found were no better or worse than they were perpetuated this false superiority.\n\u0026ldquo;Education, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery.\u0026rdquo; — Horace Mann, 1848\nMann\u0026rsquo;s remarks stand true in numerous facets. The only thing that can make two races unequal is a difference in education. The African nations were conquered because of this educational difference. True equality can only exist when everyone has the same opportunity to pursue knowledge.\nThe most significant factor for racism is education. Throughout history, less educated Minorities were pillaged and destroyed. Now even with our systems and governments that restrict that behavior, minorities are still not equal. We are not given the same resources and education; even when we are, it is still built on a weak foundation. A foundation filled with crime, poverty, and discrimination. An anti-racist institution takes a directive against the social inequalities of the community and the world.\nHope #Ending systemic racism can only be applied if everyone is on the same side. There does not need to be a complicated system or really anything new. The process of fighting injustice is humanity standing together regardless of race or gender. Conviction in what is right. I hope to contribute perspective. I was raised under a religious subtext of the methodist faith in a caucasian household. As an African American, I have struggled with my identity my entire life. Moreover, as an Ethiopian, I have found myself unable to connect to the injustice of the history of black America, but I still look into the future and see myself still suffering those same injustices. I stand alone in life; I carry social and ethnic isolation that I have not found in anyone else. I have hated this aspect of my life for as long as I can remember.\nHowever, there is no point in hating the things you cannot control. Recently I have started seeing my position as something that makes me a little unique. Every day I experience racial and social divides between the world and at home. Everyone, in the end, wants to be a part of something bigger than themselves. While individualism is a foundational aspect of America, It is within a community do people learn who they are.\n","date":"2 January 2023","permalink":"/topics/mlk/","section":"Topics","summary":"Intro #This essay was written for the MLK mentored program at the University of Louisville.","title":"MLK"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/religion-politicsphilosophy/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"religion, politics,philosophy"},{"content":"Vietnam and Korea #I wanted to hate the city from the glass stained windows to the granite walls I wanted to hate it all.

While walking through the vietnam memorial, a scar on the land, the names all blured together. from an outside persepctive names are nothing but letters strung together as a form of idenitifcan, this disconnect between idenity and name is amplified by the fact that name can be represented on a number.

How quickly despair falls upon the hearts of men, how easily we forget the brightest day when the darkest night transforms the world into a great void. I still remember when death became real, or at least real to me.\nThe shadows emerged from the fallen sun, the morningstar. Cast out of heaven and cursed into the depths of hell. As the morningstar\u0026#39;s light turned black, and the skies turned to grey, the souls of man forgot the once brightest days for then began the blackest night.\n\u0026#34;This is the last day of morality, Isaac, dost thou see those people over there? Behold their shadows,\u0026#34; my brother said. The shadows cast from the villagers in the town began to absorb their hosts. I always found my older brother\u0026#39;s sentiment to be perplexing. The shadows were the devils in the hearts of men, nothing more than the physical constructs created by the deviance of every man, woman, and child. Morals were born from the gift of mortality from the Father. A social contract for the people to follow to improve the lives of others and subsequently themselves. Or at least to the highest extent in which desert life could be improved. My brother\u0026#39;s words indicated, at some level, that a mortal heart by default is immoral.\n\u0026#34;We must go, Isaac, for Father hath warned us of these days. Make haste.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What is happening? Where are we supposed to go, brother?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;To the desert, for Father said when the morningstar falls, we must find the philosopher\u0026#39;s stone.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Falling stars? A stone? How are those two things related?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;I will explain on our journey. Take this,\u0026#34; Abraham tossed a shortened Lancea at me. \u0026#34;Hopefully thou wilt not be forced to use it, but in the night, anything goes.\u0026#34;\nOur first shadow appeared, a man unlike any I had ever seen before. Its skin was a sickly shade of green, its eyes glowing yellow in the darkness. Its limbs were elongated and thin, each ending in razor-sharp claws. A monster of pure lust, a shadow whose soul shall rest in the first circle of the abyss. It let out a blood-curdling scream that echoed across the land, and we knew we had to run. Abraham and I ran as fast as we could, our hearts pounding with fear. We could hear the creature\u0026#39;s footsteps behind us, getting closer with each passing moment. Suddenly, Abraham stopped in his tracks and turned to face the monster.\n\u0026#34;Isaac, go! Keep running!\u0026#34; he shouted.\nI hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then I saw the determination in my brother\u0026#39;s eyes, and I knew he would not let that creature harm us. I turned and ran, tears streaming down my face as I heard the sounds of battle behind me.\nWhen I finally stopped to catch my breath, I realized I was alone. The darkness enveloped me, and I was filled with despair. Abraham was not with me. My brother was so strong. If only I was more like him.\nFor the past twelve days, Abraham has been able to fight off the shadows of lust and gluttony on his own. After all, he says, \u0026#34;They are weak spirits, nothing more than those with a self-destructive craving. Their own desires bring them to ruin. They are the trespassers of self.\u0026#34; My brother has not allowed me to eat since our first night.\n\u0026#34;We are going to die out here, brother.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Isaac, thou must stay steadfast, for Father is watching over us.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;If thou sayest so, but who is that man over there?\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;IT WILL BE MINE, IT WILL BE ALL MINE, GIVE IT TO ME\u0026#34;\nVerily, the answer to my question was revealed unto me, and it was but a shadow of greed. Greed, unlike the desires we had encountered thus far, sought to take from others. It was a trespass against mankind.\n\u0026#34;I canst assist in this fight, for I have learned much from observing thee battle the other Shadows,\u0026#34; I declared.\n\u0026#34;As much as I detest admitting it, I believe thy aid may be required,\u0026#34; responded Abraham.\nAnd so, Abraham and Isaac stood before the Shadow of Greed, a creature unlike any they had encountered before, with eyes that glimmered with an insatiable hunger. The Shadow moved swiftly, lunging forward with its claws aimed towards Abraham\u0026#39;s throat.\nI sprang into action, wielding my lance at the ready. I charged towards the Shadow, catching it off guard. However, the Shadow proved to be too strong, knocking my lance out of my hand and sending me flying backwards. Abraham stood alone against the creature, his own lance gleaming in the moonlight. He moved with a grace that was almost otherworldly, evading the Shadow\u0026#39;s attacks and striking back with deadly precision. As the battle raged on, I watched in awe. Abraham was like a force of nature, his willpower unbreakable.\nIn the end, it was Abraham who emerged victorious. He plunged his lance deep into the Shadow\u0026#39;s chest, and the creature let out a final, anguished scream before dissolving into silver coins. I rushed to my brother\u0026#39;s side, overflowing with gratitude and awe. \u0026#34;How didst thou accomplish such a feat, Abraham?\u0026#34; I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. Abraham smiled wearily. \u0026#34;It was but a trifling matter, my dear Isaac,\u0026#34; he said. \u0026#34;Just a small amount of training, and a great deal of determination.\u0026#34;\nI knew that my brother was being modest. Abraham\u0026#39;s strength and courage were beyond measure, and he had just proven himself to be a true warrior of the desert.\nAs we continued our journey through the wilderness, I knew that we still had a long way to go before we found the philosopher\u0026#39;s stone, but I was no longer afraid. With my brother by my side, I was invincible.\nFor forty days and forty nights, my brother and I fought through hell. Through lust, through greed, anger and violence. Night after night, our hunger grew in parallel with our strength. Abraham never allowed me to destroy one of the Shadows. \u0026#34;Thou must preserve thy innocence, my dear brother,\u0026#34; Abraham told me.\n\u0026#34;Behold, there it is—the philosopher\u0026#39;s stone,\u0026#34; I exclaimed.\nIt was a small and unremarkable object, yet it held within it the power to rid the world of its shadows. Abraham and I gazed at it in wonder, knowing that it would change our lives forever.\n\u0026#34;So thou hast come for the philosopher\u0026#39;s stone,\u0026#34; spoke a voice from the darkness. We turned to see a figure shrouded in darkness, its eyes glowing red in the dim light. \u0026#34;Who art thou?\u0026#34; Abraham asked.\n\u0026#34;I am the collective of the stone,\u0026#34; the figure replied. \u0026#34;The power thou dost desire requires sacrifice—an equivalent exchange.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;What sacrifice?\u0026#34; I asked, my voice trembling.\n\u0026#34;By now, thou hast become acquainted with my siblings—the Shadows, the sins, the deviations. I am unlike the other Shadows; I am treachery. I am an immortal Shadow, and I shall always exist, but I require souls for strength.\u0026#34;\n\u0026#34;Brother, what art thou doing, Abraham? I beg of thee, answer me,\u0026#34; I pleaded.\n\u0026#34;To end this madness, one of us must fall; I cannot allow thee to perish, my dear brother,\u0026#34; replied Abraham.\n\u0026#34;Give me the lance, Isaac,\u0026#34; Abraham commanded.\nAs the stone glowed with a bright red light, the world around us began to change. The shadows that once plagued the land began to fade away, replaced by a warm and gentle light. The air filled with the sounds of birds singing and the scent of fresh flowers blooming.\nI looked at the stone in my hand, still in disbelief at what had just happened. My brother, my mentor, and my friend, had given his life for this. I knew that I would never forget the sacrifice he had made.\nFrom that day on, I traveled the world, using the power of the philosopher\u0026#39;s stone to help those in need. I helped heal the sick, fed the hungry, and brought hope to the hopeless. I knew that I could never replace Abraham, but I would do my best to carry on his legacy.\nYears passed, and I grew old, but the power of the stone remained with me. As I approached the end of my life, I knew that it was time for me to pass on the stone to someone else. I searched high and low for someone worthy of the responsibility, but no one seemed to fit the bill.\nThen one day, as I sat by a river, I saw a young boy playing by the water\u0026#39;s edge.

The entire reading was in Ge\u0026#39;ez script, a superset of Amharic. Ge\u0026#39;ez to Amharic is what Latin is to English. Although for someone who does not know either language, this difference did not change my experience at the Church. My own experience of religion as a part of the baptist Church was filled with thoughts of how corrupt the message of God was in the King James Bible and the English Standard. The Orthodox, however, have what I consider a complete and untouched bible, including my favourite book, Enoch. Although I do not believe I could ever return to practicing a specific religion, the Orthodox Church\u0026#39;s authenticity is untouched by the individualism that dominates the West and, for the most part, directly contradicts the teachings of Christ. The Orthodox Church is appealing to me as someone who has lived in isolation due to that individualism.\nMass before attending the Church was a foreign concept to me. My distaste of the Catholic Church has kept me from engaging in anything resembling a Catholic tradition. The best way I could describe Orthodox mass would be the purest form of praise. It is, without a doubt, complete submission to God. The most similar thing mass could be compared to would be gospel/hymns, but at a certain point, the music used as a conduit of praise overshadows the submission itself.\nMass was largely repetitive, and I usually find repeating any tasks meaningless, elementary ones. Still, theology does not have the same rules as reality does. Each action should be carried out with the heart and elevated by the mind. In that way, each repetition is entirely separate from the one before it and comes together to form praise.\nRight before the scripture reading, what my western mind processed as dancing was Wereb. I could not describe Wereb in any way that would do it justice. I will find a video to embed into this blog. What I can say is that it was a much-needed break from the hours of standing and listening to church updates in a language that I do not understand.\nPersonal Thoughts My relationship with the Church was something that I would not describe as fulfilling. My entire life, I felt that I had a piece of my life missing since I left Ethiopia. When I was first invited to go and attend the Church, I was hoping to finally fill that part of my heart.

I still believe in the topic and find it relevant. Doing research for this paper has opened my eyes to the ingrained tyranny the black community has faced, even from a religious standpoint. I have made some editorial changes for the essay to be more suitable for the blog but the main points and the majority of the text is largely untouched.\nFundamentally no one person is born racist. Racism is a behavioral pattern that is taught through culture. Racism is the product of social conditioning. Within western society, when the European nations expanded and came across Asian and African cultures, they did not understand what they found. Those Europeans found a group of people who were different. People who had different beliefs. Different Traditions.Different Values. And within those Differences, fear was born. The Europeans turned towards their God, bible, and faith as justification for slavery.\nThe curse of Ham, Ham gazed upon Noah, drunken and nude; while Ham\u0026#39;s two brothers ran to cover Noah, Ham did not. because of Ham\u0026#39;s insolence, Noah cursed Ham and his sons, the sons of Canaan. The sons of Cain.\nThe descendants of Cain were believed to be Africans, declared in the bible as \u0026#34;the servants of servants.\u0026#34;. Because the curse was ordained by God, then the existence of slavery is just. Because God is ultimately just. God was never said to have removed the curse of Canaan. Therefore with this justification, slavery was not only moral but also eternal. This establishment of slavery, even if it was unfair, God had made so. A fun contradiction to this is in Ezekiel 18:20 \u0026#34;…The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son…\u0026#34;.\nAll a measure of justification when men discover something they do not understand; fear is natural. To understand men capture, control, and enslave. The point of the story is best explained through the words of Winston Churchill, \u0026#34;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u0026#34; Always cloth naked people you see. Jokes aside, the real point of conflict here is the product of a lack of understanding. When Europeans discovered the Africans and the Asians, they placed themselves in a position of superiority. A lack of knowledge that the people they had found were no better or worse than they were perpetuated this false superiority.\n\u0026#34;Education, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery.\u0026#34; — Horace Mann, 1848\nMann\u0026#39;s remarks stand true in numerous facets. The only thing that can make two races unequal is a difference in education. The African nations were conquered because of this educational difference. True equality can only exist when everyone has the same opportunity to pursue knowledge.\nThe most significant factor for racism is education. Throughout history, less educated Minorities were pillaged and destroyed. Now even with our systems and governments that restrict that behavior, minorities are still not equal. We are not given the same resources and education; even when we are, it is still built on a weak foundation. A foundation filled with crime, poverty, and discrimination. An anti-racist institution takes a directive against the social inequalities of the community and the world.\nHope Ending systemic racism can only be applied if everyone is on the same side. There does not need to be a complicated system or really anything new. The process of fighting injustice is humanity standing together regardless of race or gender. Conviction in what is right. I hope to contribute perspective. I was raised under a religious subtext of the methodist faith in a caucasian household. As an African American, I have struggled with my identity my entire life. Moreover, as an Ethiopian, I have found myself unable to connect to the injustice of the history of black America, but I still look into the future and see myself still suffering those same injustices. I stand alone in life; I carry social and ethnic isolation that I have not found in anyone else. I have hated this aspect of my life for as long as I can remember.\nHowever, there is no point in hating the things you cannot control. Recently I have started seeing my position as something that makes me a little unique. Every day I experience racial and social divides between the world and at home. Everyone, in the end, wants to be a part of something bigger than themselves. While individualism is a foundational aspect of America, It is within a community do people learn who they are.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/posts/mlk/","section":"Posts","summary":"Intro This essay was written for the MLK mentored program at the University of Louisville.","title":"MLK"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/politicsphilosophy/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"politics,philosophy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/religion-philosophy/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Religion, Philosophy"},{"content":" History The history of the minimum wage in the United States dates back to the early 20th century. The first federal minimum wage law, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), was passed in 1938 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026#39;s New Deal. The initial rate was set at 25 cents per hour and covered workers in specific industries, such as manufacturing and transportation.\nIn the years following the passage of the FLSA, the minimum wage was increased several times to keep pace with inflation. The rate reached $1 per hour in 1956 and $3.35 per hour in 1981.\nHowever, the actual value of the minimum wage began to decline in the 1980s and 1990s due to a lack of regular increases and the effects of inflation. This led to a growing income gap between low-wage workers and the rest of the population.\nIn recent years, a renewed push has been made to increase the minimum wage, particularly to $15 per hour. In 2013, fast food workers in several cities across the United States began striking for a $15 per hour minimum wage, and the movement quickly spread to other low-wage sectors. This led to several cities increasing their minimum wage, with some reaching $15 per hour.\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government passed the CARES ACT, which temporarily raised the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.95/hr.\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour; however, several states and cities have set their minimum wage rates higher than the national rate. The history of the minimum wage has been marked by debates and controversies, with proponents arguing that it is necessary to ensure that low-wage workers can afford a basic standard of living. At the same time, opponents say that it can lead to job losses and higher prices.\nWhy Increase the minimum To combat poverty and income inequality: A higher minimum wage would increase the income of low-wage workers, helping to lift them out of poverty and reduce income inequality. To stimulate economic growth: When low-wage workers have more money to spend, they are more likely to finish it, which can help boost economic growth. To reduce government dependence: Higher wages can reduce the need for government assistance programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid. To increase worker productivity and reduce turnover: A higher minimum wage can help attract and retain better-quality employees, leading to increased productivity and reduced turnover. To adjust for inflation: The minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation in recent decades, leading to a decline in its value. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would help restore its purchasing power. To promote social justice and fairness: A higher minimum wage would ensure that workers are paid a fair wage for their labor and would help to reduce the gender and racial wage gaps. To improve the overall standard of living: A higher minimum wage would increase the standard of living for low-wage workers and their families, allowing them to afford necessities such as housing, food, and healthcare. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2023 A theoretical bill to increase the minimum wage to 15$ over the course of 5 years. It is not good but it is an easy baseline to follow as a barebones template.\nSection 1. Minimum\nThis Act may be cited as the \u0026#34;Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2023\u0026#34;.\nSection 2. Increase in Minimum Wage\n(a) The following schedule shall increase the minimum wage for covered employees:\n(1) $12.00 per hour, effective on the date of the Act\u0026#39;s enactment.\n(2) The minimum wage for covered employees shall be adjusted annually based on the percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) to reach $15.00 per hour within 5 years. The increase will be capped at 5% per year until the goal is reached.\n(b) The minimum wage for tipped employees shall be increased by the following schedule:\n(1) $6.00 per hour, effective on the date of the Act\u0026#39;s enactment.\n(2) The minimum wage for tipped employees shall be adjusted annually based on the percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) with a goal of reaching $7.50 per hour within 5 years. The increase will be capped at 5% per year until the goal is reached.\n(c) The minimum wage for employees with disabilities shall be increased by the following schedule:\n(1) $8.00 per hour, effective on the date of the Act\u0026#39;s enactment.\n(2) The minimum wage for employees with disabilities shall be adjusted annually based on the percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) with a goal of reaching $9.50 per year within 5 years. The increase will be capped at 5% per year until the goal is reached.\nSection 3. Annual Adjustments\n(a) The minimum wage rate established under this Act shall be adjusted annually based on the percentage increase of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The percentage increase will be capped at 5% per year for all categories of employees.\n(b) The Department of Labor shall publish the adjusted minimum wage rate in the Federal Register at least 90 days before the adjustment takes effect.\nSection 4. Definitions\n(a) \u0026#34;Covered employee\u0026#34; means any individual employed by an employer engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\n(b) \u0026#34;Tipped employee\u0026#34; means any employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.\n(c) \u0026#34;Employee with disabilities\u0026#34; means any individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\nSection 5. Effective Date\nThis Act shall take effect on the date of its enactment.\nSection 6. Severability\nIf any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSection 7. Authorization of Appropriations\nThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act.\nThis bill aims to increase the minimum wage in a gradual manner, taking into account inflation rate and ensuring that the increase is capped at a certain percentage each year to allow businesses to adjust accordingly while also ensuring that the goal of $15/hour is reached within 5 years for covered employees, $7.50/hour for tipped employees and $9.50/hour for employees with disabilities.\nPersonal thoughts The argument of whether the minimum wage should be increased is philosophical. The primary determinant of whether someone supports raising the minimum wage is whether someone believes that minimum wage should be \u0026#34;livable.\u0026#34; However, \u0026#34;livable\u0026#34; has incredible flexibility depending on where you live in the states. Because of this flexibility having a set raise to 15 an hour has the potential to hurt small businesses the most, especially in low-income areas. The individual is paid by the industry, but if the company can not afford to pay its employees, the only thing that happens is an increase in unemployment.\nFrom what I have seen, the largest group of individuals that support the raise to fifteen an hour are primarily people living in urban and metropolitan areas and with low-level corporate franchise jobs. Raising the minimum wage would do nothing but increase the prices of all products and services across the board. The economy would simply re-adjust itself to a position where the value of the individual dollar would be worthless. And because of that, someone making 20$ an hour would be put in a significantly worse standing.\nIn 90% of scenarios, how much someone makes is reflected in the time spent learning a skill or craft. Minimum wage almost universally is unskilled by nature. No one should be in a minimum wage job for their life because that would, in my world view, mean that they haven\u0026#39;t learned anything with time. And If that is indeed the case, that is reflective of a far more significant issue in the states.\nEducation\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/posts/minimum/","section":"Posts","summary":"History The history of the minimum wage in the United States dates back to the early 20th century.","title":"The Minimum Wage"},{"content":" History The history of the minimum wage in the United States dates back to the early 20th century.

Authorization of Appropriations\nThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act.\nThis bill aims to increase the minimum wage in a gradual manner, taking into account inflation rate and ensuring that the increase is capped at a certain percentage each year to allow businesses to adjust accordingly while also ensuring that the goal of $15/hour is reached within 5 years for covered employees, $7.50/hour for tipped employees and $9.50/hour for employees with disabilities.\nPersonal thoughts The argument of whether the minimum wage should be increased is philosophical. The primary determinant of whether someone supports raising the minimum wage is whether someone believes that minimum wage should be \u0026ldquo;livable.\u0026rdquo; However, \u0026ldquo;livable\u0026rdquo; has incredible flexibility depending on where you live in the states. Because of this flexibility having a set raise to 15 an hour has the potential to hurt small businesses the most, especially in low-income areas. The individual is paid by the industry, but if the company can not afford to pay its employees, the only thing that happens is an increase in unemployment.\nFrom what I have seen, the largest group of individuals that support the raise to fifteen an hour are primarily people living in urban and metropolitan areas and with low-level corporate franchise jobs. Raising the minimum wage would do nothing but increase the prices of all products and services across the board. The economy would simply re-adjust itself to a position where the value of the individual dollar would be worthless. And because of that, someone making 20$ an hour would be put in a significantly worse standing.\nIn 90% of scenarios, how much someone makes is reflected in the time spent learning a skill or craft. Minimum wage almost universally is unskilled by nature. No one should be in a minimum wage job for their life because that would, in my world view, mean that they haven\u0026rsquo;t learned anything with time. And If that is indeed the case, that is reflective of a far more significant issue in the states.\nEducation\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/topics/minimum/","section":"Topics","summary":"History The history of the minimum wage in the United States dates back to the early 20th century.","title":"The Minimum Wage"}]
