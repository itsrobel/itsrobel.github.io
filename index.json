Throughout history, the king was seen as a divine or semi-divine figure maintaining supreme authority over their subjects. With the establishment of democracy in the fifth century B.C.E. Athens, the king transformed into a mortal political leader who governed with the support of a powerful noble class or with the consent of a representative body. In many feudal societies, the king was the supreme ruler who held all political power and was responsible for administrating justice, maintaining order, and protecting the kingdom from external threats. Because of the innate parasocial relationship between kings and their subjects, or the more favorable term “constituents,” Kings were often considered divinely ordained or, better yet, designated themselves to be of divine origin. This “Godhood” gave way to absolute power, as no mortal subject would ever dare oppose a God. In more modern societies, the role of the king has changed dramatically. In many countries, the monarchy is now a ceremonial or symbolic institution with limited political power; instead, elected representatives hold the real power. The symbolic nature of royalty stands ever present throughout the United Kingdom. In other countries, however, the monarchy has been abolished altogether.\nIdealistic King #The fine arts and media were birthed and enjoyed by the elites – lords, ladies, kings, and queens. Subjects in the position of bards, storytellers, and arts would make a living by portraying their king in the best light to “making a living” or, more accurately, to continue living. In any case, the progression of civilizations, far-reaching outside the bounds of the obsolete feudal governance, idealizes kings as being that should be noble and just. The relevant case of media idealization would be the Great King Arthur (and the Knights of the Round Table). According to the legend, King Arthur Pendragon was a legendary British king who ruled during the late 5th and early 6th century. He was the son of King Uther Pendragon and was raised by Sir Hector as a ward of the court. As a young man, Arthur pulled the great sword Excalibur from a stone and, with that, claimed his role as the true king of Britain, As King Arthur established a court of Camelot.\nSymbolism #There is a noticeable inclination in modern civilizations to worship those who hold the position of a celebrity. Musicians, actors, and the more recent development of online influencers carry with them the same parasocial relationship as the kings and queens of feudal times. This relationship between celebrities and fans is, in part, in some way exploitive, whether that be for more money, ever an increasing political agenda, or some other social metric; this “exploitation” does happen to drastically vary from celebrity to celebrity as the level of opportunistic capacity varies from person to person, but I digress.\nIn 2018, the film “Black Panther” was released, based on the title character and directed by Ryan Coogler. The film was set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Chadwick Boseman as T\u0026rsquo;Challa/Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, Lupita Nyong\u0026rsquo;o as Nakia, and Danai Gurira as Okoye. The film was a critical and commercial success and received widespread praise for its groundbreaking representation of Black characters and themes.\nIt was also the first superhero film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film inspired thousands to millions of young people of color that they could be their king or queen.I was one of them. When I first left the movie theater at 14, I was utterly filled with hope and some pride because the people in the production “looked just like me”. In this instance, both the actor and character take the role of pseudo-kings; for the minds of youth, having a robust role model is a crucial part of developing into an adult.\nHowever, they are nothing more than public figures. These pseudo-kings hold power in mind and not by will, thus making them symbolic of whatever cause they choose part take in. And depending on the cause, it can also be their downfall as a symbol.\nLooking back, it is strange that I had such a strong reaction to the movie when the character itself was not real, and none of the events happened. There are far better role models than a King living in an isolated society fighting crime in a catsuit sponsored by a magical space rock (Yes, Vibranium is, in fact, magic, it does way too much crazy nonsense not to be, I do not care that they call it a metal). Better role models for young Black Americans would be Malcolm X, MLK, Muhammad Ali, or more contemporary leaders such as Magatte Wade, David Goggins, or Idris Elba (Yes, Idris Elba is an actor, but he is also a film developer in the West African nation of Ghana, so I am making an exception).\nI believe it is essential to clarify that these sorts of pseudo-kings and role models should be recognized as separate entities. Role models are essential in inspiring others in the face of hardship; false kings do nothing more than leach off the people, positioning them at their status level with no real power over the public besides drawing their attention. While I provided examples of famous people as role models, those two traits do not have to coexist simultaneously. A role model can be anyone, but as an idealistic model for behavior, you should avoid meeting them or letting their actions affect you directly. If the actions of a public figure do directly influence you, their role transforms into that of a pseudo-king.\nThe dragon king #The noble king is often found in media but rarely in history, as a dark mirror to the idealism of King Arthur is the realism of Vlad III. Vlad III, also known as Vlad the Impaler, was a medieval ruler of Wallachia, a region in present-day Romania, who lived from 1431 to 1476. Vlad is known for his cruelty and his use of impalement as a method of execution, hence earned him the nickname \u0026ldquo;Vlad the Impaler\u0026rdquo;.\nVlad\u0026rsquo;s father was a member of the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order founded to protect Christianity in Europe. After his father\u0026rsquo;s death, Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia, a position he held three times between 1448 and 1476. During his reign, Vlad was known for his brutal tactics against his enemies, including but not limited to…\n\u0026ldquo;impaling them on stakes and leaving their bodies to rot in public view as warning to others. Boiling, burning, and blinding.“. Some saw Vlad as a hero for his efforts to resist the Ottoman Empire, which was seeking to expand into Eastern Europe. He is mainly known for his campaign against the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, during which he impaled tens of thousands of Ottoman soldiers and prisoners of war. Vlad was eventually captured by his enemies and imprisoned, and he was killed in battle in 1476 while trying to regain his throne.\nVlad Tepe\u0026rsquo;s story is the public perception that “Dracula” has. Vlad III has been mentioned as a part of the violent tyrants of all time for his ruthlessness and cruelty. A large part of Vlad\u0026rsquo;s perception has to do a cycle of propaganda.\nVlad maintained a deep-seated hatred of the Valachian nobles who murdered his father and brother. The moment Vlad regained power, he quickly disposed of the traitorous noblemen. Naturally, the nobles retaliated by spreading false rumors and plotting to depose him. With the aid of a fake letter, they managed to convince the king of Hungary, Matthias I, that Vlad desired to ally himself with the Sultan. As a result, he imprisoned the Wallachian voivode in Visegrád. He was killed fighting the nobles after he regained the throne. “During Vlad’s imprisonment, news of his false betrayal spread through Europe, fueled further by his reputation. He became the subject of several paintings where he is portrayed as either Pilate or as Aegeas, the Roman proconsul of Patras, present at the crucifixion of Saint Andrew. Also, he is the subject of a poem written by Michael Beheims, entitled “Story of a Despot Called Dracula, Voivode of Wallachia.” It should be clear by now that regardless of how cruel he may or may not have been, that was the reputation Vlad III garnished. Vlad III was crucial in resisting The Ottoman Empire march on to West Europe, because of this was responsible for protecting Christianity as we know it now. The same Christianity that would go on to label him as Tepes as Dracula.\nWhen reality bleeds #King Arthur, I would argue, did nothing more than pick up a sword and defend his people from the monstrous invaders. In the same way, Vlad III picked up ten-foot wooden stakes and did the same thing. There are two main differences from Arthur’s and Dracula’s story. The difference is that the monsters that Arthur killed were just that monsters, that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in reality and are only a figment of our shared imagination.\nTo add depth to the character of Dracula, the vast majority of the populace claim that the primary inspiration for the vampire king was the real-life Vladimir Dracul Tepes. This basis, however, has no real merit for a couple of reasons. In Bram Stoker\u0026rsquo;s tale, Dracula follows none of the actions or even acts similarly to Vlad Tepes, other than being \u0026ldquo;bloodthirsty\u0026rdquo; but to claim that Stoker\u0026rsquo;s only reference to a Tepes was taking an abstract adjective and making it hyper-literal.\nWhile Dracula is frequently represented in the film as a direct representation of Bram Stoker\u0026rsquo;s vampiric tyrant, there are a few extraordinary retellings. My favorite is not a \u0026ldquo;Dracula,\u0026rdquo; but one that fits the \u0026ldquo;tyrannical blood lusted king archetype\u0026rdquo;.\nKing Bradley is pivotal in the “Fullmetal Alchemist” and “Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood” anime series. As the leader of the country of Amestris and holder of the title \u0026ldquo;Führer,\u0026rdquo; Bradley is portrayed as a charismatic, powerful, and ruthless leader who enforces the government\u0026rsquo;s laws with an iron fist. However, as the story progresses, his true identity as a homunculus is revealed, adding depth and complexity to his character and motivations. One of the most significant aspects of King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s character is his role as a leader. Throughout the series, he is shown as a charismatic and effective leader who commands respect and loyalty from his subordinates. He is also skilled in combat, possessing incredible speed, agility, and strength. As a result, he is often called upon to carry out dangerous missions and defend his country from external threats. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Bradley\u0026rsquo;s leadership is not as benevolent as it initially appears. He is revealed to be a homunculus created through alchemy with no soul. This revelation adds complexity to his character, as it raises questions about his true loyalties and motivations. It is eventually revealed that Bradley\u0026rsquo;s ultimate goal is to carry out the plans of his creator, Father, to create a massive transmutation circle that will grant him god-like power.\nOne of King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s most notorious actions is his role in the Ishvalan War, a conflict between the state of Amestris and the Ishvalan people. Bradley was directly involved in the war as a commanding officer, and his actions were brutal and ruthless during this time. He led the military\u0026rsquo;s efforts to eliminate the Ishvalans, using alchemical weapons and ordering his soldiers to kill indiscriminately. As a result, many Ishvalans were massacred, and the survivors were forced into ghettos. Bradley\u0026rsquo;s cruelty extended beyond the Ishvalan War, as he was also responsible for numerous assassinations and acts of terror against his people. He ordered the murder of anyone who threatened his power or the stability of the state, including members of his cabinet. He was also directly involved in creating the Homunculi, artificial beings created through alchemy, and used them as tools to carry out his schemes and eliminate his enemies. Despite his ruthless nature and questionable motivations, Bradley is shown to have a human side. He is portrayed as having a deep affection for his wife, whom he refers to as \u0026ldquo;Mrs. Bradley,\u0026rdquo; and his son, Selim. This aspect of his character creates a conflict between his duties as a leader and his relationships, as he is forced to choose between his duty to his country and his family. Overall, King Bradley\u0026rsquo;s reign was marked by violence, oppression, and terror, and he was willing to commit any atrocity to maintain his power and control. His actions serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability and justice in leadership.\nContext of kings #This section is in no way a defense of the actions of people with the role of the king. Unlike most, royalty is granted a self-autonomy that most of humanity did not have. Life before the 20th century was unapologetically terrible for everyone. Even with significantly lower economic power, the quality of life that the \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; Westerner experienced is significantly higher than the kings in history.\nHistory has been a mixed bag for different individuals and groups as progress, triumphs, tragedies, and atrocities have marked it. While some people have enjoyed great wealth, power, and privilege, others have experienced poverty, oppression, and discrimination.\nBecause of the institution of succession, most kings were born into their power. A result of hyperactive nepotism is a lot of unqualified leaders. And even those who would be considered to be qualified still often find themselves in the pitfalls of history. King Charles I was the monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1625 until his execution in 1649. He was born on November 19, 1600, at Dunfermline Palace in Scotland, the second son of James VI of Scotland and I of England. Charles was raised in the Anglican faith and received a royal education. Charles became king in 1625 after his father\u0026rsquo;s death, and he quickly became embroiled in conflict with Parliament over issues such as taxation, foreign policy, and religious freedom. In 1642, tensions between Charles and Parliament erupted into the English Civil War, with Charles leading the Royalist forces against the Parliamentarian forces led by Oliver Cromwell. The war was long and brutal, with both sides committing atrocities and inflicting significant damage on the country. In 1646, Charles surrendered to the Scottish army, but the Scottish turned him over to Parliament in exchange for payment of their expenses. In 1648, Charles tried to regain his throne by force, but the Parliamentarians defeated and captured him. In January 1649, he was put on trial for high treason, found guilty, and sentenced to death. On January 30, 1649, Charles was beheaded at the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London. Charles\u0026rsquo; execution was a watershed moment in English history, leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, which lasted until the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Charles was later canonized by the Church of England as a martyr and is commemorated in the Church\u0026rsquo;s calendar on January 30.\nThe Royal UK writes this about Charles…\n“ Charles was reserved (he had a residual stammer), self-righteous and had a high concept of royal authority, believing in the divine right of kings. He was a good linguist and a sensitive man of refined es. He spent a lot on the arts, inviting the artists Van Dyck and Rubens to work in England, and buying a great collection of paintings by Raphael and Titian (this collection was later dispersed under Cromwell). Charles I also instituted the post of Master of the King\u0026rsquo;s Music, involving supervision of the King\u0026rsquo;s large band of musicians; the post survives today.”\nCharles is a character I do not believe to be an outlier in the history of kings. In fact, I believe his rise and fall are far more representative of the history of kings than figures like King Cyrus or Alexander. That is to say, being placed on a high pedestal in society creates a level of exposure for one individual that a person is not naturally equipped to handle. Charles, the first, only cared about the purpose and his own interest, and because of the level of power that a king has, he could do what he wanted without any resistance. He failed to calculate the effects of his actions or how the public would view him, and due to that failure lost his life\nBe wary #of those who aspire to be \u0026ldquo;king.\u0026rdquo;\nA cautionary note about those who seek positions of power and authority. While not all individuals who aspire to leadership roles are inherently bad or corrupt, history has shown that many leaders have abused their power and committed atrocities in the pursuit of their own interests. Leaders who seek power for its own sake may be more interested in maintaining their own position and authority than in serving the interests of their constituents. They are willing to compromise their values, to lie, to cheat, or commit acts of violence to protect their position or to further their own agenda. Therefore, it is important to be vigilant and discerning when evaluating those who seek leadership roles. It is important to consider their values, track record, and intentions, as well as their ability to work collaboratively and listen to diverse perspectives. Make no mistake my western readers, we have kings in our world, and the most powerful ones are the ones that you do not know exist.\n","date":"26 February 2023","permalink":"/topics/kings/","section":"Topics","summary":"What is the role of King?","title":"Kings"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/philosophy/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"philosophy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":"Introduction #For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine and their counterparts, whether they be demons, djins, or any other spiritual manifestation of power. While admittedly, they are a figment of my obsession with power, angels also serve as a foundation for the universe in a cosmological sense to maintain balance.\nThe Servants of Allah #In Islam, angels are considered part of the unseen world and are believed to play a significant role in the daily life of a Muslim.\nMuslims believe that angels were created by Allah (God) and are made of light. They are not physical beings and cannot be seen by humans, but their presence can be felt.\nAngels have several vital roles in Islam, including:\nMessengers: from Allah and are said to convey Allah\u0026rsquo;s messages to humans.\nRecorders: of a person\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, words, and actions.\nProtectors: of human beings, with each person having two angels who record their actions.\nGuardians: of heaven and hell and to be responsible for guarding the gates of each.\nIntermediaries: between Allah and humans, carrying out his commands and responding to human needs and prayers.\nIslam recognizes several specific angels, including Gabriel (Jibreel), Michael (Mika\u0026rsquo;il), and Azrael (Izra\u0026rsquo;il), who are mentioned in the Qur\u0026rsquo;an. Each angel is believed to have a unique role and responsibility in serving Allah and the world.\nIn Islam, angels play a significant role in the daily life of a Muslim and are seen as constant reminders of the presence and power of Allah in the world. Muslims are encouraged to seek their protection and strive for their good deeds and actions to receive their blessings and guidance.\nIt is imperative to note that within the religion of Islam, there are no\u0026hellip;\nFallen Angels #Appear in many religious traditions to describe a celestial being who has been cast out of heaven or rebelled against God or the divine realm. The concept of fallen angels is most commonly associated with Christianity and Judaism, but it is also present in other religious traditions, such as Zoroastrianism. It is important to note that there does not exist any fallen angels in Islam.\nDisobedience to God #Spirits In the Sands #Contrary to what I just said, a few examples of falling from grace in Islamic Tradition serve as extreme outliers. The Jedo-Christan satanic equivalent in Islam is known as Iblis.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Iblis was a jinn created by Allah and was one of the most elevated and respected Jinn. However, when Allah commanded all of his creations to bow down to Adam, Iblis refused, stating that he was made of fire and was, therefore, superior to Adam, who was made of clay.\nAs a result of his rebellion and arrogance, Allah cast Iblis out of heaven and into hell, where he became the embodiment of evil and the leader of the forces of darkness. Iblis is often depicted as the tempter of humans, trying to lead them astray from the path of righteousness and into sin and temptation.\nIn Islamic belief, Iblis represents the ultimate evil and the embodiment of pride and arrogance and is seen as the embodiment of everything that is opposed to the will of Allah. Due to Iblis\u0026rsquo;s nature as a Jinn, he is not an angelic fallen.\nThe Morning Star #In Christian and Jewish traditions, the fall of the angels is typically associated with the story of Lucifer, a high-ranking angel who rebelled against God and was cast out of heaven as a result. According to tradition, Lucifer and the angels who followed him became demons and are now seen as agents of evil and corruption in the world. Or at least that is the popular interpretation of Lucifer. The name Lucifer only appears once throughout the Bible in the Old Testament.\nIsaiah 14:12-15 KJV\n12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. over the years many believers have taken this count of Lucifer and equated him to Satan the king of Hell and demons. However the subject of this passage is NOT Satan but instead a Babylon king\u0026hellip;\nIsaiah 14:4-5\n4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 5 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. This misconception about Lucifer is rather frustrating as it is a core aspect of the Christine doctrine. From what I can tell, the rise in popularity of seeing Lucifer as the Devil was more or less a political move from the Church to garnish more power. If promising eternal life would not convert the masses using fear would. And that fear could inviability be used for control.\nThe Poison of God #Samael is a name that is associated with various religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism. My favorite interpretation of Samael is within the Talmudic and post-Talmudic literature. Samael holds the title of the left hand of God and his name directly translates to the venom of God. In Jewish tradition, Samael is sometimes portrayed as an angel or demon who is associated with death and destruction. In some texts, Samael is depicted as the accuser of God\u0026rsquo;s people and as the leader of the evil spirits a synonym for Satan.\nMost importantly, however, Samael is directly responsible for the fall of Adam as Samael was the one who seduced Eve in the garden of Eden. From his Affiar with Eve, a child was born. Humanities first murderer and the man cursed to eternally walk barren lands, Cain.\nIn many tellings of creation, Samael is said to be the lover of Lilith, Adam\u0026rsquo;s first wife, with their union being the dark mirror of Adam and Eve. From their union, they birth the demons, demons that would then be used by Lilith in a revolt against God. As a result, God castrated Samael and was said to banish him from Heaven and sentence the fallen angel to serve as the guardian of Esau.\nThe last notable encounter with the Dark angel appears in the\u0026hellip;\nAscension of Moses #\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, \u0026ldquo;Anger,\u0026rdquo; and Hemah, \u0026ldquo;Wrath,\u0026rdquo; whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, \u0026ldquo;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,\u0026rdquo; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. \u0026ldquo;This one,\u0026rdquo; said Metatron, addressing Moses, \u0026ldquo;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Whither goes he now?\u0026rdquo; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, \u0026ldquo;To fetch the soul of Job the pious.\u0026rdquo; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, \u0026ldquo;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.\u0026rdquo; \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nThe Two other faiths where Samael makes an appearance are Gnosticism and Kabbalah. In Gnosticism, Samael is often portrayed as a powerful and malevolent deity who is opposed to the true God and is responsible for the creation of the material world. Some Gnostic sects saw Samael as the demiurge, the architect of the physical universe who was responsible for the suffering and imperfections of the world. Throughout the Kabbalah, Samael is seen as one of the Sephirot, the ten attributes of God. In this tradition, Samael is associated with the sefirah of Gevurah, which represents strength, power, and judgment.\nWith so many writings and stories about Samael, no one truly knows the entirety of his existence. The only thing certain is that if at all possible, it is wise for any mortal to avoid the poison of God.\nThe Watchers #The \u0026ldquo;Watchers\u0026rdquo; are a group of angels mentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish text that is not considered part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible but is still considered significant by some religious groups, such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\nAccording to the Book of Enoch, the Watchers were a group of 200 angels who were sent to earth to watch over the human race. However, the Watchers became enamored with the beauty of human women, took wives for themselves, and began teaching humans about various heaven secrets, including astrology and magic. This teaching was seen as corrupting humanity and leading them astray from God.\nAs a result of their rebellion, the Watchers were punished by God and cast into a deep prison, where they were to remain until the end of time. The offspring of the Watchers and their human wives were the Nephilim, who were seen as powerful and evil beings.\nThe Book of Enoch is considered by some to be a pseudepigraphical text, meaning that it is attributed to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah, but was likely written much later and by an anonymous author. The text\u0026rsquo;s exact historical origins and significance are still the subject of debate among scholars.\nIn these traditions, fallen angels are seen as having once been good and obedient servants of God but who have now become corrupted and are in opposition to God and His purposes.\nThe concept of fallen angels is an important part of many religious traditions and is closely tied to the beliefs about the nature of good and evil, the balance of power between the divine realm and the mortal world, and the idea of divine justice and retribution.\nSeparation of Divine #In Hinduism, devas are celestial beings or gods that are responsible for various natural phenomena and are worshiped as such. They are often portrayed as having supernatural powers and are seen as divine beings of light and goodness. Devas play a significant role in Hindu mythology and are often depicted as having an ongoing struggle with the asuras, which are considered forces of evil.\nIn Buddhism, devas are also seen as divine beings that inhabit higher realms and possess supernatural abilities. However, unlike Hinduism, Buddhism does not worship them as gods but rather sees them as beings that have achieved a higher level of spiritual enlightenment. According to Buddhist teachings, devas have the ability to assist and guide human beings toward enlightenment, but they are still considered to be bound by the cycle of birth and death, just like all other beings. Ultimately, the goal of a Buddhist is to achieve enlightenment and become a deva. Overall, the concept of celestial beings in Buddhism and Hinduism is different from that in Western religions, as the focus in those beliefs is on individual spiritual development and the attainment of enlightenment rather than a belief in a hierarchy of divine beings.\nBecause of the overall cosmological structure of Hinduism, Buddhism, and other closely related eastern faiths, their celestials do not appear to have any \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo; ones. Those who would be classified as evil are almost preordained as such.\nThe Will of Man #The reasons for why God created humanity vary depending on the religious tradition and belief system.\nIn many monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, God is viewed as the creator of the universe and all things within it. The creation of humanity is often seen as the crowning achievement of God\u0026rsquo;s creation, and the reason for humanity\u0026rsquo;s existence is typically framed as an expression of God\u0026rsquo;s love and wisdom.\nFor example, in Christianity, God is seen as having created humanity in His own image, with the intention of having a close relationship with them and bringing them into His kingdom. According to the Bible, God created humanity for the purpose of fellowship and to enjoy a relationship with Him. In Islam, Allah created humanity as His vicegerents on earth and charged them with the responsibility of upholding justice, balance, and order in the world. It is believed that the ultimate goal of humanity\u0026rsquo;s existence is to worship Allah and attain salvation in the hereafter.\nAside from the monotheism doctrines, in Hinduism, the creation of humanity is seen as part of the cycle of creation and destruction, with humans serving as the means by which the divine can experience and understand the world.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s greatest gift, in many instances, is that of free will, free will to create, free will to love, but more evidently, free will to destroy. In the celestial realm of Angels, God\u0026rsquo;s existence is guaranteed; it is present and known.\nReflect on the countless interpretations of the concept of God that have emerged throughout history. Consider the numerous individuals who, convinced of their beliefs, have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of what they perceived to be just. Ponder the countless innocent lives that were cut short due to the actions of these crusaders.\nBut Angels, angels don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer, do they? They already live in heaven; what more could anyone want? I used to be able to ease my mind by using the rationality that Angels are Slaves, and in Islam, they are. However, Being inclined to be Jedo-Christian, my mind is constantly stuck on the thought of hating my mortality.\nIf Angels have free will to sin, falter, and fall while being creations of unspeakable power and the ability to fight demons. How is humanity Gifted? Instead, humanity is cursed with the existence of the celestials. The Nephilim, unholy spawn of the Watchers, ravished the sons of man until the flood. Samael Orchestrated the fall of Adam and then fathered the first great sinner and the demon race. Even if you do not subscribe to Samael\u0026rsquo;s existence, he still exists conceptionally in the morning star.\nDespite the existence of suffering and uncertainty that humanity is faced with, it is all part of a larger divine plan. However, the phrase \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s plan\u0026rdquo; is often used to justify unjust suffering, which is not acceptable. When I refer to \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rsquo;s plan,\u0026rdquo; I acknowledge that everything we encounter in life is small in comparison to the greater cosmic picture. I hold the belief that there is a righteous way to live and that each individual has their own understanding of what that means. I do not believe I will ever have all my questions answered to the extent that I desire. That uncertainty about life is what makes it worth living.\nThe only certainty is that humanity possesses free will. Live in uncertainty, connect with those around you, and embrace their unique perspectives. We live mortal lives; each decision we make from sunrise to sunset is how we will be remembered when we pass on. I argue you live each moment as if it were your last. Do not let differences in beliefs or ideologies prevent you from seeing the humanity in others.\nAs humans, we are free to suffer in our own ways, and because of that, relief is all the more joyous. In a way, we are more blessed than the celestials. Man is born with a clean slate; ultimately, free will does not mean being free of consequence. Stay true to yourself and your convictions, and may an angel of God guide you to your paradise.\n","date":"1 February 2023","permalink":"/topics/angels/","section":"Topics","summary":"For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated with the divine","title":"Angels"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/religion/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"religion"},{"content":"Introduction #While I typically like to write these kinds of pieces with as little emotional bearing as possible, the nature of my into the Orthodox Church is entirely personal to me. This piece will mostly go over the nuances of the Church from a westerner\u0026rsquo;s perspective and then any personal notes about the Church and the relationship I have with it after attending the Christmas service.\nIt is important to note that Orthodox Church that I attended was Eastern Orthodox of the Ethiopian people. Anything I say here may or may not apply to other Orthodox churches or even other Eastern Orthodox. I will use the protestant Methodist and Baptists Churches on my reflection points since I know the most about them and have attended them for years.\n** The angels in the details Upon entering the Church, it is mandated that an attendee must take off their shoes before entering the sanctuary. While this initially caught me off guard, I quickly rationalized it as a step toward keeping the holy place clean of the outside world\u0026rsquo;s filth. Other details that I will mention later also play into this idea.\nThe sanctuary was divided with men on the left and women on the right. Both sides had their respective paints, the most notable being the ones of the archangels Michael and Gaberial on the left and right, respectively. These paints, or icons, are meant to depict a story and not simply just a still. The presence of icons surprised me and amazed me. My impression of the Orthodox Church until being in one was that it was more of a blend of the faith Christianity and traditions more kin Islam. The presence of the Ideals proved that to be a false assessment.\nWith that being noted, the reason for Idols is one that I am fond of. Westernized Christianity\u0026rsquo;s use of imagery is simple and straightforward in conveying meaning, and if not, can often be explained with a single word. The best example of this (and my favourite painting) would be Michelangelo\u0026rsquo;s Creation.\nThe Icons in the Church were covered using a transparent white cloth. It was explained to me after the service that In Ethiopia, the fabric had the practical use of protecting the Icons from the ground but was still visible to any onlookers. While the Church did not have to worry about this issue, the Tradition was still past on as a symbolic remembrance.\nThe service began at 9 pm on January 6th and ended at roughly 3:16 am January 7th, Christmas day, of the Gregorian. On informing of the time, my desire to attend the service was put into question by my friends and family. The timing did not stop me for personal reasons that I will get to later and because having the service would be during the time of transitioning from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day. The structure of the service later supported this rationale.\nWhile I only vaguely remember the order ( in my defence, it was late ) There were four parts; Introductory/what I assume to be church events, scripture reading, Mass, Baptising/communion. I say what I assume to be because the only part of the service that had a translation was mass (which you best believe I was thanking God for).\n** The Night The scripture reading was the Christmas story and the journey before Christ was born. The entire reading was in Ge\u0026rsquo;ez script, a superset of Amharic. Ge\u0026rsquo;ez to Amharic is what Latin is to English. Although for someone who does not know either language, this difference did not change my experience at the Church. My own experience of religion as a part of the baptist Church was filled with thoughts of how corrupt the message of God was in the King James Bible and the English Standard. The Orthodox, however, have what I consider a complete and untouched bible, including my favourite book, Enoch. Although I do not believe I could ever return to practicing a specific religion, the Orthodox Church\u0026rsquo;s authenticity is untouched by the individualism that dominates the West and, for the most part, directly contradicts the teachings of Christ. The Orthodox Church is appealing to me as someone who has lived in isolation due to that individualism.\nMass before attending the Church was a foreign concept to me. My distaste of the Catholic Church has kept me from engaging in anything resembling a Catholic tradition. The best way I could describe Orthodox mass would be the purest form of praise. It is, without a doubt, complete submission to God. The most similar thing mass could be compared to would be gospel/hymns, but at a certain point, the music used as a conduit of praise overshadows the submission itself.\nMass was largely repetitive, and I usually find repeating any tasks meaningless, elementary ones. Still, theology does not have the same rules as reality does. Each action should be carried out with the heart and elevated by the mind. In that way, each repetition is entirely separate from the one before it and comes together to form praise.\nRight before the scripture reading, what my western mind processed as dancing was Wereb. I could not describe Wereb in any way that would do it justice. I will find a video to embed into this blog. What I can say is that it was a much-needed break from the hours of standing and listening to church updates in a language that I do not understand.\n** Personal Thoughts My relationship with the Church was something that I would not describe as fulfilling. My entire life, I felt that I had a piece of my life missing since I left Ethiopia. When I was first invited to go and attend the Church, I was hoping to finally fill that part of my heart. What I found instead was the constant feeling of being an outsider. My people\u0026rsquo;s language, traditions, and minds were completely different from my beliefs and way of life. At midnight, for the first time in my life, I believed I was not Ethiopian. If the community is what forms Identity, I had no right to claim to be part of those people and taint the perception of the community with my disgraceful actions.\nFor about nine months to date, I have identified as agnostic. And while at the Church, through the incense and the cries of the young, I truly believe God was present. And for those who don\u0026rsquo;t believe in a God of the Earth. God exists within the hearts of the people. And as an abstract construction of the mind, God is present. During my time there, I bowed before God and the love of the people, prayed with them, and prayed for them that a truly holy place would never fall.\n** Quest for God I will continue to learn and educate myself on the history and life of my bloodline until I have earned the right to identify as such. The next step in my religious Journey is Islam and reading the Qur\u0026rsquo;an. I hope that everyone can find peace in life through their God and worship to fill their hearts with love.\n","date":"10 January 2023","permalink":"/topics/christmas/","section":"Topics","summary":"While I typically like to write these kinds of pieces with as little emotional bearing as possible, the nature of my into the Orthodox Church is entirely personal to me.","title":"Christmas"},{"content":"Intro Intro #I am incredibly lazy, and instead of writing original content for my about page, I will simply copy-paste my common application. I never ended up applying to any university with it, but I do think it does an ok job at representing me and my personality.\nVoid #Each step is no more complicated than the last, a simple motion, a progression in thought. Walking is always different and never distinct. When walking, the world becomes a void and nothing more than a background to the universes in your head. In my universe, there is a shining star.\nOutside of religion and higher powers, the justifications for natural laws and moral rights feel like 4th-dimensional mental gymnastics. One of the more debated philosophical concepts is the simple question, “what is the meaning of life?” Religion’s more innate and extraordinary power is that it provides meaning to life, but without it, one finds ideologies that vary in quality. If you were to ask some hitchhiker this question, you might get something as random as the number 42. 3rd-century philosopher saint Augustine believed that God is good and the word of God is good; anything outside of God and his teachings is the source of evil. A life without God creates a void, and that void, I believe, is often misrepresented. The philosophical emptiness of nihilism.\nUrban dictionary defines nihilistic as “A word that nobody really knows what it actually means but is often used by [pretentious]book and film [critics]so that they can feel [smug].” While this is not an actual definition, it alludes to the mysticism surrounding the term. Nihilism is paradoxical in meaning. Nihilism paints the world with a colourless black brush—an empty yet endless void of meaning. A belief in nothing is still a belief in something. Nihilism is a physiological response to suffering. Suffering is only worsened by the idea that resisting is futile and pointless. In accordance with the development of nihilism, my path began as a response to the things I could not control. “blood is thicker than water.” My elders always told me. A belief that family, that blood was the essential thing in life, that meaning was derived from such. By the time I was born, there was already a void in my blood.\nMy blood in fatherhood had long since run stale to the ruin of time. Soon after, the blood in my grandmother breathed its last breath. My blood in maternity was quick to be forgotten. My Ethiopian heritage became nothing more than a box to check on forms and applications. A checkbox that meant nothing since I had already lost all semblance of culture. The prospect that blood was of the highest importance was a void I could not fill.\nUnder nihilism, there can be a certain level of optimism in rejecting that anything has innate value; you can set those values. I put my values into reaching the stars, constantly reaching for new knowledge and higher understanding with each breath. This value system, while beneficial educationally, still failed to fill the void. I grew up in a universe that never felt like my own, an alien lost in the stars. In my search for meaning, I found other “aliens,” people who differ in beliefs, ideologies, and blood. I found a universe of scholars, creators, and dreamers. I was able to fill my void with a community. A community that taught me a lesson my elders had inaccurately informed me. “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” The bonds we choose to make with those around us are more valuable than the ones we are born with.\nEach religion and word of God throughout history are retellings of the value of community to educate individuals on how to live righteously. Eventually, I had to leave my universe of aliens so we could return to our homes. I remain still an alien, but with the hope that through education, I can one day create a universe of my own so that other aliens do not have to walk alone and gaze into an endless void and instead see their stars.\n","date":"2 January 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Intro Intro #I am incredibly lazy, and instead of writing original content for my about page, I will simply copy-paste my common application.","title":""},{"content":"Intro #This essay was written for the MLK mentored program at the University of Louisville. I still believe in the topic and find it relevant. Doing research for this paper has opened my eyes to the ingrained tyranny the black community has faced, even from a religious standpoint. I have made some editorial changes for the essay to be more suitable for the blog but the main points and the majority of the text is largely untouched.\nFundamentally #no one is born racist. Racism is a behavioral pattern that is taught through culture. Racism is the product of social conditioning. Within western society, when the European nations expanded and came across Asian and African cultures, they did not understand what they found. Those Europeans found a group of people who were different. People who had different beliefs. Different Traditions.Different Values. And within those Differences, fear was born. The Europeans turned towards their God, bible, and faith as justification for slavery.\nThe curse of Ham, Ham gazed upon Noah, drunken and nude; while Ham\u0026rsquo;s two brothers ran to cover Noah, Ham did not. because of Ham\u0026rsquo;s insolence, Noah cursed Ham and his sons, the sons of Canaan. The sons of Cain.\nThe descendants of Cain were believed to be Africans, declared in the bible as \u0026ldquo;the servants of servants.\u0026rdquo;. Because the curse was ordained by God, then the existence of slavery is just. Because God is ultimately just. God was never said to have removed the curse of Canaan. Therefore with this justification, slavery was not only moral but also eternal. This establishment of slavery, even if it was unfair, God had made so. A fun contradiction to this is in Ezekiel 18:20 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nAll a measure of justification #when men discover something they do not understand; fear is natural. To understand men capture, control, and enslave. The point of the story is best explained through the words of Winston Churchill, \u0026ldquo;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u0026rdquo; Always cloth naked people you see. Jokes aside, the real point of conflict here is the product of a lack of understanding. When Europeans discovered the Africans and the Asians, they placed themselves in a position of superiority. A lack of knowledge that the people they had found were no better or worse than they were perpetuated this false superiority.\n\u0026ldquo;Education, then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery.\u0026rdquo; — Horace Mann, 1848\nMann\u0026rsquo;s remarks stand true in numerous facets. The only thing that can make two races unequal is a difference in education. The African nations were conquered because of this educational difference. True equality can only exist when everyone has the same opportunity to pursue knowledge.\nThe most significant factor for racism is education. Throughout history, less educated Minorities were pillaged and destroyed. Now even with our systems and governments that restrict that behavior, minorities are still not equal. We are not given the same resources and education; even when we are, it is still built on a weak foundation. A foundation filled with crime, poverty, and discrimination. An anti-racist institution takes a directive against the social inequalities of the community and the world.\nHope #Ending systemic racism can only be applied if everyone is on the same side. There does not need to be a complicated system or really anything new. The process of fighting injustice is humanity standing together regardless of race or gender. Conviction in what is right. I hope to contribute perspective. I was raised under a religious subtext of the methodist faith in a caucasian household. As an African American, I have struggled with my identity my entire life. Moreover, as an Ethiopian, I have found myself unable to connect to the injustice of the history of black America, but I still look into the future and see myself still suffering those same injustices. I stand alone in life; I carry social and ethnic isolation that I have not found in anyone else. I have hated this aspect of my life for as long as I can remember.\nHowever, there is no point in hating the things you cannot control. Recently I have started seeing my position as something that makes me a little unique. Every day I experience racial and social divides between the world and at home. Everyone, in the end, wants to be a part of something bigger than themselves. While individualism is a foundational aspect of America, It is within a community do people learn who they are.\n","date":"2 January 2023","permalink":"/topics/mlk/","section":"Topics","summary":"no one is born racist.","title":"MLK"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/topics/politics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"politics"}]
